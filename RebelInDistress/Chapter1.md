The Mighty Nein agreed they weren't going anywhere out of town until they had seen the beacon themselves, so Beau and Caled decided they might as well check up on Pumat Sol in the meantime.

As they walked, Beau noticed Caleb was more than his usual quiet - he was almost walking into people on the street before she steered him around them.

"Yo, Caleb - are you present?", she asked, snipping her fingers twice in front of his face, right after yet another person had dodged his careless walk.

"Hm? Ja.
I was just..." he started, as he drifted off again.

A worry crept over Beau's face, as she inspected her friend's expression.
"Is it that Ikithon-guy you have on your mind?" she probed with some concern.

His eyes flagging around, he just nodded quickly.

"Look, there's like no chance he's gonna hurt you.
You got us all around, you have just been in the presence of King Dwendal himself and I know he said he doesn't trust anyone blindly, so he will call them on their bullshit if you, like, vanished or something."

Caleb licked his lips as he gather his thoughts.

"It's not his... ehm.
No, I was reminded of something from back in the Academy."
He glanced around to see if there were anyone following them before he continued with a low voice.

"He had this big vault which only he was able to access, and I bet you that is where the beacon is being held at this moment."

Beau's one eye shut up.
"Only *he* could access?
Like, because of some magic shit?"

"Ja", Caleb nodded.
"Long story short; he would always take a small knife and poke himself on his thumb, smear a droplet or two of blood on his fingers, and touch the vault front.
He made us try just to verify."

"Oh, like Yussa and his tower back in Nicodranas, where only he and Wensforth can get in?", Beau asked.

"I... I don't know", caleb continued thoughtful.
"But I think it's related to blood, while Yussa's tower is just the right individual.
It might be, that-"

But Beau interrupted him with a light tab on the shoulder:
"We're here.
HEY, Kathedoc!" Beau called out to the older half-orc Archivist, who was walking around, tending to the wounded.

Glancing around, both Beau and Caleb noticed way fewer beds around, and those left was not in half as bad a state as the day before.
"So, is Pumat Sol still around here?" she continued.

Scratching his hairline, the old half-orc takes a second to think, before it dawns for him:
"Oh, no he got better, but is still not at his best.
Ehm, he went to the library in the Court of Colors to get his mind off things, I think."

"Did he go by himself?" Beau followed up.

The half-orc started nodding again.
"I think so, yes."

"Right - thanks", she finished turning to Caleb.
"You know the way, right?
Cause I haven't been here a whole lot."

His brows contracted a bit, Caleb nodded and pointed west.
"Ja, it's just a 10-15 minutes walk to the Tangles, past the through the Vigil's Circle.
There might quite a bit of trade going on at this time of day, so... you know."

Beau gave a sigh, as she put one leg in front of the other.
"Well, lets go!" she exclaimed with a bit too much energy for Caleb's taste.

Fifteen minutes later, the came to the beautiful cerulean building with four short multi-level domed towers of polished blue stone.
The library was located in a broad side street to the traders, and didn't see a lot of activities, on a daily basis from non-members.
But as the two arrived Beau was puzzled that the front door held a sign 'closed for lunch', since there were plenty of people running this place, and she had never heard of it closing in the middle of the day.

"Well", she said as she stretched her back a bit.
"It's not closed when you are an expositor", and she pushed the door open.

As the light fell in, a young guy was hanging behind the front desk, in a position with his head leaned towards the wall behind him, eyes closed, and a hand over his stomach.

"*Expositor* Beauregard visiting, young man" she said in a firm tone, but without any effect on the clerk.

Knocking hard on the desk not two feet from him twice, also seemed to have no effect.

Caleb nudged her on her should, as he pointed with his other hand to the clerk's resting hand, that seemed to have a red hue to it.
"Is that...?"

Beauregard realizing the clerk wasn't sleeping, jumped the desk, removed the hand, and saw a stab wound in the young man's lower abdomen.
He was still breathing, but there was an intoxicating smell from his face, and it was not booze.

"We have an intruder", she murmured quietly, before she spun around shouting it at her lungs' full force: 
"INTRUDER - WE NEED A MEDIC!"

"Pumat!" Caleb exclaimed, as he started running into the grand library.
Build to keep books stored, shelves ran in several rows in the ground plane, leaving space only in the middle of the building where a grand cylinder of twirling staircases allowed access to the basement and the first floor.

Scanning the empty tables, Caleb made a quick decision to split to search for their friend;
"I go low, you take upstairs!" he called over his back, as Beauregard was pointing another member to the wounded.
She set in motion as well, sprinting up the staircase 4 steps at the time, shouting out "PUMAT - WHERE ARE YOU?!"

As Caleb got to the floor of the ground level, he quickly spotted his firbolg friend at a desk, alone, with a walking stick next to his chair, and a pile of books in front of him.
*Ah, wunderbar*, he thought to himself, just as his eyes fell on the top of the nearby bookcase where a figure in dark outfit loomed.
The hooded figure glanced to Caleb, thought Caleb couldn't see the eyes.
They then lunged from the 10 feet tall towards the wounded firbolg, a thin sword drawn in their right hand, as a young man's voice cried: "I need your blood!"
