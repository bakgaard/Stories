# Rebel in Distress - Chapter 2

Quick reactions have kept members of the Mighty Nein alive.
Caleb's ability to think fast and react was what kept his friend alive again, as he quickly mumbled a spell while swirling his hands in a swift pattern, blasting it at the assassin jumping towards Pumat Sol.

If Caleb had spend more time on telekinetic, he would have had a better outcome, but the firbolg friend had shown he could withstand a bit of bludgeon damage the day before.
The assassin froze his movement midair as the spell to hold he muscles tensed their body, leaving them flying towards their target without being able to plunged the thin blade, nor land in anyway that could lessen the fall.

The assassin's face connected with Pumat Sol's with a hard smacking sound, which send the shop owner tumbling back over his chair and the assassin further into the floor, as Caleb call out his partner:
"BEAU - DOWN HERE!".

He had at least 40 feet to the two and he really needed to keep his concentration up for the spell to hold.
Pumat slowly stumbled to his feet away from the hooded figure, as Caleb could feel a pulse of resistance from the young assailant - like a mix of hatred and desperation fighting to get out of, which the guard at the Iron Shepherds' never got to experience.
Leaning towards the railing on the staircase, his focus on one target, he felt a relief as the blue drabs of Beauregard came rushing down the stairs past him with a dashing speed.

"We need him alive", Caleb shouted to her, as her first fist dived into the assassin's guts, followed by a knee in the groin, an elbow to the chin, before she wrapped herself arm around the throat of the hooded figure, locking him in a tight grip.

"I GOT HIM", Beauregard shouted over her shoulder, as Caleb release his focus on the guy whom imitatively started attempting to wrestle his way out, but to no avail.
Quickly realizing so, he started wheezing at Beauregard which was expected of any person in a strong headlock, but the words were not what she had expected:
"I need... you *must* let me..."

"Oh Hells no, you don't", she retorted.
She had the human male locked rather well - there was no chance he was fighting his way out of this.

"Please... magic... contract...", the voice uttered in the lock.

Caleb had come closer, his fingers gloving with faint, white, arcane magic, ready to release it at any given point.
His face did not change from his serious expression even though that did surprise him:
"What magic contract?"

Not able to see the face of the assassin and without an immediate response, Caleb made a quick decision.
His hands started emitting a bit of golden glowing sand, as he put his hand on the head the hooded figure, who quickly relaxed their entire body.

Beauregard shot him a glance of confusion.
"I put him asleep", he said as he reach his open hand towards her to help her up.
"It should keep him pacified for now".

As Beauregard released the body, grabbed Caleb's hand and pulled herself up, her focus went straight to their firbolg:
"Are you alright, Pumat?"

Visibly shaken, Pumat had his cane in both hands which vibrated with an unnerving force.
"Ehm - I have some mixed feelings, I must admit."
His tone was his usual self, but he seemed both surprised and slightly shaken.
"But I am still here, thank you for asking."

She went to haul him to his feet as well, as she turned to Caleb:
"What do you think that magic contract he ushered was about?"

Caleb bit his lip as he shook his head:
"I am not sure, sorry, but I would very much like to find out."
He turned his attention to Pumat:
"Do you have a magical contract he was after?", he asked with slight curiosity.

Getting his footing with the cane, Pumat scratched his head a bit:
"Well, I have a lot of those, but I do not think I have one for him.
Though I do like to find out what this is about, since I do not like getting ambushed."

"Well, we do have a cellar or two here", Beauregard injected with her staff swung across her shoulders.
"I'm pretty sure the Cobalt Soul have a few questions for him as well."
