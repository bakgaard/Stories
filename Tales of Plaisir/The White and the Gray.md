# The White and the Gray

The two stood in the hallway, where they had been handed a single envelope.

“That’s an order, or what would you say, mr. Calu’?” the man said, as he looked at the very tall dragonborn.

The white brute shifted a bit, as he looked at the enveloped. “Indeed. You’ ready to go?” he replied.

Natalis nodded. Both of them had only known each other for a half an hour - just as an easy way to let them know, that they would be working together, and they had had the time to warm up to each other.

The dragonborn made a slow bow to his left, and picked up a shield and a morningstar, held them in one hand, as he drew a symbol in the air, while muttering a few words.
Both he and the old divination wizard felt a warmth, as the blessing wrapped around them.

“Now I’m ready” he said, as he took the morningstar back in his right hand, and went for the exit.

“We need a plan” Natalis said, as he kept close to the dragonborn’s left side.

It was just past 8 am, and the sun was up over the walls of Chambéry, as the two stepped outside into the light. The people of the capital had started their day hours ago, and the market was humming in its usual tones, as merchant shouted their tradeables, towncriers tried to inform the citizen of news, and ordinary folks trading what they needed.

“A plan, you say” Calu’ asked, as they made their way towards the docks - their destination for today.

“Uh yes - we can’t just barge into the place, demand they begone, and hope for that to stick for tomorrow” the wizard gave back.

The dragonborn turned his head a bit towards the half a meter shorter human, with a raise brow. 
“Why not? That have worked out great for me so far”. He was left with a bit of a wonder - that had actually worked out amazingly well for him before. It seemed to leave a mark on those he came around.

“Well” Natalis started. “The envelope we were handed specifically said, that the individuals who bothered the client were addicts and the likes.” 
He had to take a few extra steps to keep up with the tall ally of his.
“If we push them out, they will just come back, and since this won’t keep them away, we won’t be fulfilling the contract”.

It took a few seconds before that sank into Calu’s mind, as he stopped, turned to look at the wizard he had only been in company with for a rather short timespan.
“What do you suggest then?”

It was as honest an answer as the wizard had heard any of his companions give. They somehow always insisted, that their way would be better than his, and it was rarely the case. 
“Well, they are at the docks for a reason, right?” he said, trying not to overload his new friend too quickly with too many arguments.

A quick nod let him know to continue.

“If we find the reason for them to be there…” he continued without finishing, letting the seed plant themself.

“...we get rid of the addicts” Calu’ finished, as he snapped his fingers, pointing at Natalis. “That sounds like a solid plan”.

The old man closed his eyes, shaking his head a bit.
“No, that’s no a plan. That’s just a course of action” he said, as he opened his eyes to look at the tall guy. He couldn’t have gone too fast already, could he?

“Okay, let’s say we go to the docks, and you start swinging your morningstar - that would cause the local enforcers to come stop you, and we won’t get anywhere getting rid of these hobos.” One step at the time. Better go easy on this fella.
“Let’s say we show up, and just observe these hobos while they go on doing what they do, which is…”

By the looks of Calu’s eyes, he was only barely following.
“They… steal from… and harass the locals at the docks?” it came slowly, as he nodded to himself.

The wizard gave a broad smile.
“Yes, exactly. Now - addiction is a horrible thing, I’ve read.” He clapped his hand to seal the statement. There was no reason for that to be something to argue about.
“An addict is only an addict, because they are addicted to a substance of some sort. That means, that the addict must get it from somewhere, correct?”

The eyes of the white tower had started to look up, not to get distracted by anything, as they stood in the middle of the streat.
“Aha” he said after a moment of processing it.

“And to get the substance, the addict must trade with something, correct?” the wizard continued with a soft voice.

“And they trade…” the dragonborn started, “with what they steal”. He had finally picked up on the line of thought.
“So, what, we take away what they steal, when they do?” he asked a bit confused.

“No-no-no-no” the wizard said in a friendly tone. “We wait for them to steal something, and then we tail them to where they trade for the substances they need. And why would we do that?” Natalis asked a bit hopeful.

The face of the dragonborn didn’t change, but the eyes narrowed a bit, as the thoughts started to settle in. 

“The addicts need the substance, but if there are no substance to be had…”

The old man opened his hands as a salutation, before he finished Calu’s line: “... they won’t be at the docks. And that is what the contract specifies, correct?”

Caluturim Drulkonshtargid straighten his back. He got it now - take out the drug dealers, and the addicts went away by themself. 
“Wasn’t that what I said to begin with?” he asked.

“No, you were saying you wanted to get rid of the reason the addicts were here, which is the substances.” Natalis Levot had a smirk on his face. “We are getting rid of what keeps the addicts here” he said, as they headed toward the docks.

The docks wasn’t far from the quarters where Maison de Bénédiction housed some of their employees. As the two went on, the initial plan was to find an addict, tail them, watch them commit a crime - not too hard to do, since they were really bad at stealing stuff, but extremely slippery when it came to running away from their victims - keep on tailing the addict, and see where they went to get their substances from a dealer.

As they reached the docks, it turned out they could skip the first two steps, as a greasy haired halfling, with thin arms, and a racked set of clothes came sprinting past them, and into an alley with shout of “thief” coming after him.

He was too fast for Calu’ to catch him, and he had too much momentum for Natalis to hold him back, so as the halfling sprinted between them, they looked at each other with an expression on their faces of confidence, and started jogging in the same direction.

As they peaked around the corner, they could see the halfling 30 meters down the small alley, inspecting a bag in his hands - most likely the goods he had stolen.
Natalis poked the white ally of his on the shoulder, as he whispered: “Perhaps we should speed up this poor fella’s motivation to go to the dealer, hm?”

The wizard gently knelt down, as he steadied himself. He pulled out a bit of fleece from his pocket, as he muttered a word to himself, then pointing at the halfling down the alley. As the addict inspect the bag he was holding, a spider the size of a watermelon crawled up, stretching its fangs and snapping them, before vanishing into the thin air. The addict gave a high shriek, then dropped the bag before he fell where he stood.

Calu’ would have laughed out loud, had he not been aware - this must have made the addict think he needed another fix. He nudged the old man, and gave him a thumbs up, as he looked back into the alley.

Panting for air, the halfling was clutching his right hand over his heart, as he pulled himself up in a corner - clearly shocked by the experience, but most likely also aware, that the spider hadn’t been real. He looked confused up and down the small road between the buildings, as he massaged his left arm, and sniffed heavily, before he stood up, and walked further down the road.

Calu’ broke the silence: “To the dealer?”

Natalis raised his eyebrows shortly before he confirm: “Oh yes - he is going to his dealer. Any chance you will lead the way?”

The leather around the grip of Calu’s shield gave a crackle as the firm hand squeezed it harder.
“Oh, do I” he said with a look of determination, as they as silent as possibly headed after the halfling.

It wasn’t easy though. Calu’ was a huge bloke, to say the least. And with his tail slowly rocking from side to side, he had to be careful not to bash into anything as he snuck after the addict.

The halfling turned the corner without looking back, and the two pursuers followed a safe distance later. 

“Now, remember Calu’ - the addicts may be our problem, but the solution is the dealer” the wizard said, as they continued tailing the addict.
“I can’t put numbers on it, but there’s a good chance they won’t be happy that we take away their supply of substances. So you better be prepared for dealing with some of them when we find the hideout.”

Calu’ had stopped, and turned to Natalis with a stern expression.
“Let me be clear on my priorities here, my good sir. The contract did say we needed to get rid of the addicts, but the one spreading this chaos among the people of Chambéry must be a cruel individual, who can’t see beyond their own gold stash.” A grim expression had crept up on the face of the tall dragonborn, as he looked for the halfling.

“I may be serving the Maison de Bénédiction, and fulfilling their contracts, but the laws of Bahamut comes first for me. And I guarantee you, that the monster who deals this, must be shown no mercy for what he has done to the innocent of the capital.“

He turned his attention back to the wizard, as he continued.
“I have no intention of taking him alive. The chance that such a slimy creep might get himself out, is absolutely unacceptable.”

Natalis made a grimace, before replying.
“Perhaps… we could talk to him?” he said as a suggestion, as Calu’s eyes narrowed his. “... before you smash in his skull?”

There was a small pause, as the white brute weighed the words, before he nodded. He turned his attention back towards the alley the halfling had walked in.

The addict had come to a door a fair bit down a shadow filled passage. He made a knocking pattern on the door neither Natalis nor Calu’ could make out, said some muttered words, and the door swung open.

When it had closed, the duo walked up near it, halting 5 meters from it, as they looked at each other.

“So far, so good” the dragonborn said.

“So far, so good indeed” the old man confirmed, before he started to inspect the door at a distance.

“The plan was to find the dealer, and remove him and his substances. We are at that part now, yes?”

A nod came from the wizard, as his eyes narrowed the lock. 
“As soon as we have eyes on the criminal, I suggest we subdue him as fast as possible.”

“What tricks do you have up in your sleeve, besides illusions?” Calu’ asked, not judging but rather for information to plan the attack.

“No tricks. I wield the supreme power of the arcane”, he said with a spark in his eye.

The white brute wasn’t visibly impressed.
Natalis held his index finger up, as a flame blazed with a minor furry.

“And fire…” he finished, before he looked back at the door.
“But allow me to use the power of the mind to get this opened, my boy”. 

Calu’ gestured with his shield towards the door, as Natalis walked infront it.
He held his knuckles up to the door, and knocked in the pattern of ‘Cham-béry’, before he awaited the response from inside.

It was a hoarse voice, that snapped back: “WHAT!?”

The wizard gestured to the brute to stand back to the wall at the building. “A customer” he simply replied.

A small shute flung open, as a a pair of big, black brows with small beady eyes glared out. 
As the spit could be felt from the words “get lost, old fool”, the shute slammed shut. Natalis - visibly annoyed - wiped the fluid away, as he looked to the serious paladin. He gave him a short nod towards the door, as he stepped up next to it.

Calu’ flexed his shoulders a bit before he took Natalis’ place, as the wizard gently knocked on the door again. As the words “DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME” bellowed from the inside, Calu’ took a step forward on his left leg, as he held up his right.
In the very same instant the shute opened, the right leg of the dragonborn hit the door with such a force, that it blew off its hinges, sending both door and door man flying inside the building.

With the shield held firmly to the shoulder, the paladin roared as he entered the building, quickly followed by a wizard with a firebolt in his hand, ready to fire.

There were screams, roars, sound of metal against metal, shattering of porcelain and windows, before a dark haired elf was tossed out on the rooftop.
He had serious burns on his back, as he tried to crawl away, but his right leg looked as if broken, and he wasn’t getting far, before an elderly gentleman emerged from the door, followed by a huge white dragonborn - both with eyes that could have taken his life.

The elf seemed to struggle with words as the two slowly stepped next to him. 

The old man broke the silence with a very polite tone: “My good man, you have done so much bad to the city and the docks… I can’t even call you a good man, can I now?”

The elf was coughing up blood, as the dragonborn continue in a serious tone: “Can we even call him lawful?”

The wizard shook his head slowly. “No, he sells goods he must not, and he fence what he must not. We can’t call him that either.”

The morningstar started to rock back and forth as a pendulum, before the elf finally got his throat clear.

“You fools” the elf said in a low voice. “You can’t take me out of business. I am protected by-”

A growl from the dragonborn cut the elf off: “You hurt the people of Chambéry!” He took a step forward, and stepped on the elf’s broken leg with most of his weight. The elf wailed as the bone started to slowly crack.

The wizard bent down next to elf. “Protected by who? Who do you work for?”
The paladin apparently didn’t care. “Why does that matter? This bastard is who the contract said we had to get rid of!”

“We need him to tell us, Calu’. Another might take his place!”

The elf was fading, it seemed - heavily heaving for air. 

“ANSWER HIM” Calu’ shouted at the drug dealer, as he hammered the end of the morningstar into the stone next the elf’s head.

“Maison Wrona” he gasped, as blood filled his mouth, before he laid still.

There was a moment of silence, as Natalis kept his kneeling position in pure shock. He looked to his companion with wide open eyes, as the fury slowly left the white brute.

Their eyes met, and Calu’ broke the silence. ”What? Is that bad?”

The old man slowly got up, as he brushed his robe while he looked to the buildings around them, noting a shady figure vanishing behind a wall.

“This is not good. No, not at all” he stated calmly, as he wiped some dust away from his eyebrows. He took a deep breath, before he continued.
“It is very likely we have been seen here, or that some of the addicts got away…” he continued, before Calu’ interrupted:

“But that’s what the contract said, right?”

“For the addicts to go away, and stay away - yes. But the code of Maison de Bénédiction also states we are not to interfere with other organizations, unless it has been cleared at a higher levels. And I seriously doubt this has been cleared”. 

He held a pause, as Calu’ puzzled asked: “But we got the contract - they must have cleared it, before sending us here.”

“Say they didn’t know, my dear boy - What would be the consequences?”

Calu’ had to think for a moment. “Mmm… they would come for us, right?” He wasn’t fond of the idea.

“Indeed - if they know who we are. Luckily for us, we didn’t barge in saying our names, so now they only have the description of us to go on.” He gave the paladin a worried look.
“An old human male, is not uncommon here…”

Calu’s eyes went wide, as he whispered: “But a large, white dragonborn is”.

Their eyes met, and they were now at the same wavelength.

“But we had a contract” the wizard continued. “And we asked them nicely to begin with, so there a good chance the two of us might need to lay low for a while, as the maison takes care of the matters. We are under its protection after all”.

The dragonborn nodded slowly, as he assessed their surroundings. The human led them inside again. 

“But we need evidence. If we don’t bring anything for our superiors to see, it would be their word against the world. Help me search for something that…”  

He didn’t get further, cause he had already found what he was looking for - a few bottles of various colors. He held them up to show Calu’, as he put them in his pouch.

“Evidence” he said in a gentle tone.

Calu’ had not quite shaken the consequences that was set for them, and just nodded as he glared around inside the building.

“What do we do with all of this?” he said resignedly.

“Well,” Natalis started. “We have our evidence, but if we leave this as it is, they might get evidence to prove something else. Also - these were bad people, we could only hope Bahamut would forgive, right?”

He looked to Calu’ as he held up his flaming finger. 
“Better not leave any evidence, and speed up the process for your deity.”
