# Non Playable Characters

## Mallard

Human in his fifties, slender built, balding head with a few grey strains on the side, wearing a fine dark green robe with distinct patterns running all the way on the edges.
He is always accompanied by two young adults, Avyann and Zag, who carry out orders for him.

Mallard is the Spy Master for the king, and holds power higher than the city guards, though not above the city guards, meaning if it ever comes to a debate between him and them, he will have most say, though he cannot command them to do anything but "not interfere".

Mallard has been given a special mission from the King;
Retrieve the missing Staff of Orumanus stolen from the vault below the castle.
The king won't step before his people until it has been retrieved.

Mallard has a very strained relationship to the city guard's commander, Captain Mohrdiax. 
They don't see eye to eye on the methods used to keep order in the city, and Mallard suspects the captain to be corrupt, but does not have time to investigate it.



## Avyann of Wintherspire

Human female, 16-17 years old, with sharp eyes darting around, and mid-long dark brown hair set to her left side.
She is always seen with a shoulder bag (of Holding) walking in the shadow of Mallard, the Spy Master, with her trusted colleague, Zag, scribbling down and keeping track of Mallards calendar and contacts, reminding him of everything he needs to do and know.

She talks fast, have very little time and temper for bullshit, and owes Mallard a *huge* favour she cannot even repay by saving his life.
Mallard has agreed to let her make amends being his personal assistant, promising her a very interesting life in the odd and exiting layer of life he lives in.

She has been taught magic - all of it non-harmful, to help Mallard and Zag, and get them and her out of complicated situations.

The debt she owes Mallard came around, as she almost blew up the king and his court, and Mallard erased the memory from everyone present.
The problem is, that this is not permanent beyond Mallard's life, and one day she will be in major troubles.



## Zag / Zagoneth Zormenos

Zag looks like a very young elf but is a shadar-kai on the run from his clan and family.
Sent on a mission to eliminate the noble family of Wintherspire, he couldn't carry through with a single assassination, and betrayed his own brother who had taken out the entire family but for the youngest daughter.
Although it set the girl in a morale dilemma; him saving her life, but his family killing her's, the two fled together as more of Zahoneth's clan would come to finish the job.

Zag and Avuann sought out a way to hide themselves by magical means, leading them to a wizard's tower where they attempted to sneak in.
It failed, and the two people in the tower - the wizard and Mallard the Spy Master - caught them and, long story short, gave them both an item to hide them from divine detection.
Due to "an accident" while , Zag's face got so badly varnished, that he needed an additional item to give him the spell *Disguise Self*.

They had to do a job for the old wizard, which accidentally almost ended up killing the king of the country.
To compensate for this, they ended up in Mallard's service.



## King Zanser Harridan the Third

Half-elf male 108 years old with a black pointy beard and ponytail - survived two marriages to humans, has three kids in the mix, but finds himself in a pickle - he died, but is now a ghost, clinging to this world, though he has been confined to a ritual chamber just beneath his throne.
Very few people know of his actual condition, though everyone knows he is gravely sick.

He rules by "whispering" in the ears of his most trusted counsellor, who will relay on to whomever needs to be spoken to under the pretext that "the king is very ill, won't step into the light due to light sensitivity of his 'illness', but still listens to his servants' needs".

He does care, but he is clinging to his existence on this plane, and has ordered his Spy Master, Mallard, to find the Staff of Orumanus to bind his soul back to his body, which lies in the ritual chamber in perfect condition.



## Captain Mohrdiax

Minotaur male, late 40s, with grey fur and two black horns curling forward.
His demeanour is hard and cold, but he is loyal to the king, and keep order and peace in the city is his first priority.

Although he upholds the law for the common folk and the petty thieves, being captain has to have some boons (he figured), and paying him can make him turn the blind eye to crimes he can't see directly hurting others. 
So if you run a business with contraband, you better have coins ready if he comes by.

His guards of the city respects him, even though they know he doesn't run the show as one might think he would.
He goes on patrols himself, and if there are busts to be made, you can be sure he is part of it - how else should he get his bribes?


## Maw Schackles

Gnomemale, 70ish, with black slick hair, piecing eyes, and a calculated smile to reflect his mind.
Maw runs one half of the underground activities, competing against an unknown amount of leaders who all seem to have the same mind set, but each only have small fractions of the underworld..

Maw is by all means a commoner in adventerer skills - he doesn't know magic, he can't use a knife but to cut cheese, and he is not stealthy or athletic.
But he can convince, bribe and blackmail people like no one else.
His men digs up dirt,plant fake evidence for Captain Mohrdiax to find (which he is also blackmailing), and hinders business of people without other pressure points.
He is not too good to not do something to get his way, but he rarely have to kill - he needs people, because they make the wheels spin.

Maw does have kids (7 and 9)and a wife.
Saying he loves them is a stretch, but he values them greatly.
Threatening them would be a bad idea, and acting on it makes you disappear.

Small note: his wife is a powerful witch, and she can handle herself, but she hides it from everyone but Maw.

# The syndicate

7 different leaders, each running their own part of the underworld for Zulquienn, the mind controlling Aboleth.
They will kill to get their will, though "usual means" are attempted first.

## Zulquinn

Aboleth, 1400 years old, recently had its cave reopened after being trapped, and took control over the ones who did it.
Hates every deity-worthshipping individual, and as it saw that most big organizations are lead in the name of dieties, it set itself on a quest to destroy them through their own means, attempting to take what it can by force, and crumble the world of men and elves.

Currently 7 individuals of great use has been brought before it, and its minions now control half of the underworld.

Its current enemy in getting anywhere is not the forces of good, but the one who holds the other half - Maw Schackles.
