Adrex was sitting relaxed in the shop with his notebook and a pencil, tabbing the top corner of the blank arc.
The deal he had struck with the twins were rather simple: he would get the formula for black powder, and he would find out how long it would take for the explosive part to be at its maximum height when shot up.
But that was tricky, for some reason.

He put down the pencil, and took the apple next him, tossing it up a few inches, mentally tracking how long it took for the apple to land in his hand.
He used a bit more force, tossing the apple a bit higher into the air, noting the time from leaving his hand to grabbing it was longer.

No surprise.
That made sense.
More power - more height - longer travel time.
And he wasn't really interested in how long it took to fall down again, since that would be too late for this purpose.
So all Adrex had to do, was find the time it took to get the apple up.

He looked at the iron stamp which held some loose parchments down, and then looked back at the apple in his hand.

*The heavier the object I send up, the more power I need*, he thought to himself.
He had had harder problems before, so this just needed a lot of testing.

He put the apple down, picked up his pencil, and wrote "light ball" in the top of the paper, and "heavy ball" halfway down the paper.
Then he drew two arrows under section - one horizontal, one vertical - wrote "powder" under the horizontal line, and "height" at the vertical line.
He started tapping his pencil at the corner again, as he rested his head in left hand.

*So, if I use no powder, I won't get anywhere - that's for sure*, he thought to himself, as he made a small cross where the lines met.

*And if I use a lot of powder, I will get high up*, he murmured to himself, as he made another mark at the opposite end of where the lines met.
He stared at the paper.
He couldn't quite predict if it would be a straight line from the first mark to the second, or if the line would bend upwards or downwards.
Well, no need to glare at this for too long.
He needed to test it anyway, but it would have been nice to have an idea of what to expect.

He closed his notebook just as the door swung up with the sound of the little bell, as Yurgunn and the gnome, Cleff Tinkertop, came through the door.
His black bush of a beard was easy to recognize, with small patches of white-gray hair here and there, with large spectacles in front of his eyes with extra lenses to flip in front of as well.
His tucked up shirt underneath his brown apron told Adrex, that the gnome didn't care that much about his appearances around other tinkers, cause there was business to be had.

As they stepped inside, Yurgunn sent a determined look towards Adrex - she had most likely made a good sales pitch, and now Adrex just had to seal the deal.
Adrex stood up, as the gnome noticed Adrex was there.

"Ah, Adrex me' boy - good to see you again" the gnome said with a genuine delight.
"How is it clickin'?"

Adrex adored the gnome.
He was a bit like Adrex himself in a way; 
If you could tinker a bit with the items, you could make something new of it.

"Mister Tinkertop" Adrex said, though happy to see him, not fully focused.
"Good to see you as well.
I assume Yurgunn have told you of our latest concept?"

The fuzzy eyebrows of the gnome made a small jump, as his right eye narrowed Adrex.

"Ey - and it really sounds like you had the... 'wheels turning'... for this one, eh?" he said, as he blinked to Adrex.

Adrex smiled, looking to Yurgunn who gave him a big grin.
He opened the door to the back room, and showed Cleff to the setup he had shown Yurgunn earlier.

After the demonstration, Cleff was clearly impressed, as he inspected one of the small wheels in his hand, with an extra lens in front of his spectacles.

"So precise..." he muttered, before he turned his attention to Adrex.
"It must have taken a lot of attempts to make them fit?" 
The question was both of curiosity but also of wonder.

Adrex couldn't help but smile, as this was actually a huge compliment for him, before he shook his head.

"It took two attempts, before I got it right" he said, as he picked up the largest of the wheels.
He pointed towards one of the cogs, as he started to explain:

"The individual cogs are not just a tooth. 
They have very precise angles".
He pointed to the edge, before continuing:

"But it's not just an angle from the edge and inwards.
From the very tip is a rounding, which ensures the wheels spin as smooth as they can, and each cog's length and width are very precisely carved."

Cleff sent him a look of disbelief, as he adjusted a lens to better see the wheel he was holding.
Adrex fetched his notebook, as he turned to one of the latest pages which explained the math with detailed drawings.
He put the notebook down in front of Cleff, as he pushed it across the table.
The gnome started tracing written text with a finger, as he nodded, made a halt to think, nodded again, and continued through the notes.

After a few minutes, he finally uttered the words: 
"I see...", not taking his eyes from the pages and the wheel in his hand.
"Most fascinating, Adrex", he continued, as he flipped a page.
"I can't leave this place without a copy of these notes, rest assured.
I have plans already" the determined gnome said, perhaps most to himself.

He flipped another page, which landed him on the second most recent, which had two words underlined at the very top:

***Black powder***

The gnome froze with the flipped page still between two fingers, as Adrex tried to grab the book from him, gently pulling it away.

"Ah" Adrex started.
"That was... not-"

But he was interrupted by a serious index finger from Cleff, pointing straight into the air in front of him.

"Two things" he said, as precise as a soldier could shout commands.

"First, I am sorry to have been looking too far in your notes.
I thought there was more belonging to this".
He held a small pause before he continued.

"Second - that is dangerous stuff to be tampering with, me' boy".

Yurgunn stood at the side of the table, with her companion to her right side, client and long time friend to her left, with a very concerned - though hard - expression on her face.

She snatched the notebook from Adrex' hand, and she flipped to the page in question.

"What do you mea-"
She stopped as she saw the words underlined.

There was a moment of silence, as she looked from the dragonborn to the gnome.
She raised her head a bit, as she said with confidence:
"We have dealt with worse before, such as lethal poison, you know".

Cleff took off his glass, and pulled out a cloth to clean them.

"It is not the powder I will warn you about, me dear." 
He took a breath as he found a seat, putting his spectacles on again with a small tremor.

"Adrex - what do you know about the group called 'Vox Machina'?"

Although only said as a simple question, the words sent a shiver down Adrex' spine. 

"Eh, they were the ones who defeated Vecna almost 20 years ago, right?"
He hadn't heard a lot about them, and what he had heard was conflicting.
It was an odd group of *very* powerful adventures, who had traveled the continent of Tal'dorei, apparently slaying dragons and a demigod, which sounded crazy had it not been for hardcore facts to back it up.

Cleff nodded.
"Indeed, they did.
Now, they had a range of different abilities to do what they did - each of them strong in their own way" Cleff continued.

"One of them had a long metal stick, which were often referred to as 'a boomstick'.
He actually had several with him, to be precise."
His tone had reached a low registry.

"The short ones he called 'guns', and the long ones he called 'rifles'.
I don't know how they work, but I know that this -" he pointed to the notebook in Yurgunn's hand, "- is a requirement for them to work.
And I know of this since I know the son of the man who sold the exact compound to them."

There was only the faint breath of Cleff to be heard in the room, before the gnome spoke again.

"... and I believe you know that son's two daughters" he finished with a small smile in his right cheek.

*Daughters?* Adrex thought to himself.
*Two of those... that can only be...*

A stammer from Adrex uttered: 
"Y-you mean... Victoria and S-Smearchuckle?"

The dwarf pushed a stool to Adrex, as she took a seat on her own.
She tried to clarify it:

"Are yeh' say'n, tha' the two girls' grandpa' sold-" she waved the book twice in front of her "-to Lord Percival d' Rolo himself?" with a small disbelief and accusation.

Cleff made a small nod as his fussy eyebrows shot up, his lips tight.

Adrex couldn't get his head around it.

"Why is that bad? 
It sounds like quality!?" he said bewildered.

Cleff's eyes darted back to Adrex.

"Quality, indeed, me' boy.
And nothing wrong with it." 
He took a deep breath, and narrowed his eyes.

"The story goes, however, that their grandfather once sold some of it to a woman, who had stolen one of these guns from Percival. 
And based on that information, Vox Machina tracked her down, and killed her on the spot."

Both Yurgunn and Adrex was as locked in place, and didn't take their eyes off the gnome. 
Almost simultaneously they swallowed, before Yurgunn asked with worry:
"Just 'cause she ha' one o' his... guns, was e'?"

Cleff gave a half nod, half turned with his head.

"Something about them being very dangerous in the wrong hands, I think" he said, with his gaze down into table with the wheels.

"But hunt her down, they did... twenty years ago."

He looked back up at the two.

"I don't know what you intent to make, but you usually make traps", he said a bit tired, though with a smile on his face.
"Be careful about what you do with it."

He clapped his hands together, as he stood from his chair.

"So - you mentioned a price earlier, Yurgunn.
I'll take it, if I can have the notes on a clean set of parchments."

He went to leave with Yurgunn, who glanced back at Adrex just before she left the room. 
He was currently frozen to the place, not looking anywhere but where the gnome had left his warning.

Adrex' mind was racing with questions and concerns.

*They killed her for having it?
Just for having it?
And now I am making something like it... for others even.
Oh, dear Bahamut, I will be putting everyone in danger if I do this.
And what about me? ... and Yurgunn? 
If they find out, they will take us out on the spot.*

He started to look around, at nothing in particular, as his balance started wavering.

*So don't do it, right? 
If I don't do it, they can't come after me...
Wait, I signed a contract with one of those magical seals on - I have to do it!
SHIT!* 

He placed his hands clasped together in front of his snout, as he started to tap his fingertips together.

*There has got to be a solution to this - come on, Adrex - think!
If I don't deliver, the Xhorhasian Empire will come after me.
If I deliver, Vox Machina will come after me.
That means I... have... to please them both?
Gah - how can I make something by not making it?
Do a half-assed job, so neither consider me to be worth a threat, and claim the task to be impossible? 
Wait, that might actually work.*

The finger clapping stopped only for a brief moment, before they continued.

*Nah, I have to it correctly, or we'll loose our reputation everywhere.
'Hammer & Scale can't deliver' - pff. 
Not happening.*

He started walking around the work bench, which he so often had done when something was troubling him.

*We have to deliver to the Xhorhasians - we can't get around that.
We deliver, and... tell no one?
It will fulfill the contract, and if we are discrete, Vox Machina won't ever know we made them.
Mhm - that might be alright.
Then we just need to tell no one, and those who knows something, we pay off.
Nah, that won't last.
Money makes people do all sort of things.
We have to...*

Adrex trailed off - he was getting down a very dark line of thinking.

The door to the room suddenly slammed shut, making Adrex jump in his place, as an enraged Yurgunn matched into the room.

"Oh, Yurgunn, please don't-" Adrex started, but was cut off.

"SIT", she shouted, as she slammed Adrex' notebook into the work bench. 
Adrex butt found its way to the stool right beside him very fast, being sure not to utter a sound, as his mentor sent him a death glare.

Her voice rang with perfection, as she started walking back and forth:

"I leave yeh' for ONE hour, being specific 'bout not givin' away our secrets, but instead yeh' pick up someone else's, dragging a whole bunch o' problems over our heads."

"When I told yeh' tha' take initiative last week, it was to encourage yeh' to *say* what was on yeh' mind - not signing deals on a whim, trading secrets on a whim, and showing it off to the first person yeh' see!".

She went around the bench to the green scaled dragonborn, who seemed to have become smaller over the shoulders, and almost a foot shorter, as her voice had become a bit softer, though still not pleasant:

"I would have asked if you ever used tha' big head o' your, if it wasn't for the amount of gold pieces we just earned from it", she said, as she grabbed him by his shoulders, shaking him a bit.

"Now THA' was some great stuff yeh' did, Adri'!"

She tapped him on his right shoulder, as she found her own chair, in which she sank down, resting her head in one hand over her eyes.

Adrex didn't know what to say.
She wasn't wrong.
How could she see it in another light? 
He had single-handedly signed the contract the Zhorhasian had brought in, went to chat with the twins only to bring back the recipe   a legendary group of adventures would outright kill him for, and let someone else know he had the information.

Well, that was maybe putting it on the edge.
Yes, the contract was entirely on him, but he had thought it was as ordinary as any contract they had ever done.
The black powder was unexpected though - he couldn't have known that was illegal to possess by some mighty adventures.
And that Cleff had seen it was not intentional, to say the least.

But here they were.

"Look, Yurgunn. 
I am sorry about all of this.
I... I didn't..."

He felt bad, and had no words to express it.
He had brought them into a bad position, even though he hadn't meant to.

Yurgunn made a long sigh, as she looked up from her chair.

"Tha' contract is some real shit, Adri'" she started, shaking her head.

"Can't we get out of it?"

She shot a glance at him, as her tongue made some movement inside her mouth.

"I never told yeh' why I came ta' Hupperdook, did I?" she said softly, all of the hard tone gone.

"Well", Adrex started, trying to recall it.
"You mentioned your old master, and that you came to seek out new challenges."

"Ay, I did tell you that.
But tha' wasn't exactly the right reason."
She sent him a sad look.

"I had a master once, who could turn every piece o' metal to an exact shape.
Nothin' was too complicated, and nothing stood in his way, so we worked on all sort o' odd jobs no one else could complete.
One day, however, he signed a magical contract to deliver som' rods te' withstand any force sent against it."

She drew a breath, and exhaled deeply.

"Well, long story short; it couldn't, and I had no master anymore.
Magical contracts have some fine prints, that set consequences if not held up to the agreements, and this one was not good."

Adrex stared at Yurgunn with his eyes wide open, finding it hard to swallow.

"How... how severe are the consequences of the one I signed?"
He could feel his heart hammering away, as she looked at him.

"Not good" she said, making a face that indicated the severity was just as bad as her old master's.

*I am doomed!*

That was about all going through Adrex' mind, as the implications sank in.
He couldn't get out of it, and now he had to watch out for some crazy people.

Although dragonborns' facial expression are less visible than most other creatures, Yurgunn apparently had no trouble seeing them.
Maybe it was his eyes than had turned red, or the two lines of salty water than ran from his chins, as he quietly sat there, heaving for air, starring at the notebook which in minutes had torn the world around him apart.

As she stood, and put her arms around him for comfort, a high pitched sound could be heard from Adrex:

"Please don't shout", followed by a very heavy breath, as his eyes closed, and his chest started to jerk up and down.

"I won't, Adri'", she said as she rubbed her hand on his back.

"I'm so sorry, Yurgunn" he finally let out, as the sobs became audible, and he buried his face in his hands, unable to hold back his fears.

Although it didn't last last, and it after a few seconds became more like a whimper, Adrex had suddenly found some determination, as his breathing became more consistent.

*One thing at the time, dummy.*
*What will kill you first are the Xhorhasians, and then* maybe *afterwards Vox Machina*.
*Don't get killed, and don't fuck up even more.*

He stood up, as Yurgunn released her hug around his shoulders, reached for the notebook, tore out a page, and wrote down a short list, before he handed it to his master.

"We need this from an alchemist", he sniffed with some sort of determination, before he turned to the back of the workshop.

"Are ye' sure you don't wa-" Yurgunn started before Adrex cut her of.

"I don't have time, Yurgunn.
I need to do this, and I don't have long to do it." 
He had started looking at some metal scraps they had laying around in a few boxes.

She looked over the list, tired and worried.
A quick glance at her apprentice, and she knew he was in a mood she couldn't get him out of.

"Ay... I'll lock tha' door before I go... don't open fo' anyone, o'right?" she said.

There was no reply from Adrex, but scramble rustling around.

He had to do something to make up for this mess he had put himself in, and he needed to do something fast.

Point of order - get the twins' data, so he could move on with more pressing matters.
And to get that, he needed something he could test his powder in, but not burn the whole place down.

*No, that's too small*.
*That's too thin.*
*This has a hole in it.*

As he furiously rummaged around the scraps from earlier projects, he could hear the doorbell ring, the door close, and the lock being turned.
As as soon as it had, he took the first thing in the box he could keep in his hand, and hurled the tube through the room, as he drew a full lounge of air, and let out a roar of mental pain and anger as loud as he could, his breath visible in the air around him, before he fell to his knees, tears streaming from his face once more, as the tube clanged over the floor, rolling up next to him.

The roar didn't last more than two seconds, and quickly turned to a whimper.
Soon after it turned into a few coughs, as the air around him slowly cleared from the poisoned gas he had breathed out.
It didn't hurt a lot, but he had to fan his hand before his nostrils before he could inhale clearly again.

"This is crazy!" he quietly thought to himself.
"How can someone come after me for something I haven't even done yet?" 

He rolled around to lay on his back, as he picked up the tube, and lightly tapped it on his snout.
What was it Glenn had called them?
Guns and rifles?
And made of a long metal tube, like this one? 

His eyes narrowed the tube, as his mind started to pick up speed again.

*It's a tube, which means something can flow in a direction*.
He blew a quick breath into it, as small pieces of dirt flew out the other end.

*And if I apply pressure in one end, I blow things out the other*.
He picked up some metal dust, rolled it into a small bead, placed it in the tube with his left thumb, and blew through the tube again.
The little ball flew out, and made a small *thud* as it hit a box at the shelf.

*This is basically a cannon*, he thought to himself, as he rolled another ball, loaded it into the tube, took a breath, and fired the ball at the box again.

*A time expensive process, because I need to load a ball, and I need to take a breath, before I can fire it*.

He picked himself up to a sitting position, as he looked into nothingness, deep in thought of how to reduce these steps.

Cannons where huge, heavy, and required a lot of powder for the heavy metal balls - mostly to shoot through ships.
He didn't need huge, didn't want heavy, and he didn't need a heavy metal ball, since he wasn't to shoot through ships. He only needed to hit a target and make it hurt.

He gathered another ball, placed it in the tube, took a deep breath, held his right hand as far from the tube's ending he could, and blew as hard as he could.

"Aw!"

He shook his hand numb the pain. 
That actually hurt quite a bit - not for long, but still.
He turned the tube in his hand, as he inspected it.
It wasn't heavy, it just required some pressure, and it had made his hand hurt.

"So how much powder do I need to stuff into the bottom of this to make the same pressure, if not more", he said aloud to himself.

He pulled himself to his feet, found his notebook, turned the pages to the graph he made earlier, and starred at it.

*More power - higher up...*
The new variables was how much it weighed, and if the tube could hold it.
