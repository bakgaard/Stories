When Yurgunn came back to the shop with the new equipment, she could see Adrex most certainly had not taken time to feel sorry for himself.
All wheels and cogs were gone from the workbenches, replaced with a weight, parchments, small bowls, strings, a lot of tubes, saws, and drills.

Her apprentice was fiddling with some parchment and a tube, and as she sat the bag at the table, her face clearly showed she was trying to figure out what it all was for before asking.

The bag had not settled on the table, before the dragonborn had snatched it, and taken out the small containers with the refined niter in.

"O'ight, Adri' - fill me in this time... before *we* do it" she said, pushing the last part a bit.

As a container popped open, Adrex flipped his notebook to her with the recipe for black powder.

"We are making black powder" he said in a monotone voice
"... and the potassium nitrate you just collected, along with the sulfur, are what do most of the job.
We just need to mix it with some charcoal, and we could start make fireworks our self."

"Are we to make fireworks for the twins?" his master followed, confused but also a bit judging.

"No, I ehh..." Adrex started, as he gathered his thoughts.
"I went up to the twins, they were upset because of some feedback from a customer, and had started fixing the issue.
We talked a bit back and forth about how a rocket can only have so much powder before it blows up, and I suggested they send it up through an explosion in a tube, and the rest could be ignited with a fuse."
As he looked over to Yurgunn, he could see her eyes wide open, to which he hurried to add: "- and we agreed they could have that idea, if I could make a prototype for them."

When Yurgunn spoke, the disbelief was clear:
"Yeh' suggested them to make a cannon with explosive balls?"

Adrex had a hard time countering it, as he puffed out some air through his mouth, looking at nothing in particular.
"Well, it sounds harsh when you say it like that..."

Yurgunn took another look at the tubes, picked one up the size of an arms length, and held it from her hip in one hand horizontal outwards with the other.

"We are making cannons yeh' can carry..."
Her head started nodding, as her mouth made an grin.
"A' like it, Adri'. 
That could be a great way to fulfill the contract!"

Her smile faded, as she held the tube in her hands, starring at it at bit bewildered.

"So, how do yeh' intend to make tha' work?" she said, curious more than judging.
"Yeh' gonna fill some powder in a tube with only one end open, and then place the explosive ball afterwards?" 

Adrex looked up from the containers, and nodded.
"Yeah, something like that", he said plainly, his attention still on the materials.

A more skeptical frown could be seen on Yurgunn's face now.
"So lets say yeh' close this end", she started, pointing to the tube, "yeh' fill it from the other end, and let it slide down, aigth?"

Adrex had started weighing the white powder on the weight, confirming with a distracted "mhm".

Yurgunn glanced at the workbench to all the tools.
"Can A' assume yeh' will drill a hole at tha' end to ignite it, just like a cannon?"

Carefully placing more powder on the cup on the weight, Adrex confirmed once more with the same sound.

"Then please tell me how yeh' intent to fix the problem of flipping the tube upside down" she replied, as something that was dead obvious to everyone, as she flipped the tube 180 degrees, letting the end she had pointed to be straight up in the air.

Adrex let the weight settle, as he reached for a small tube next to him along with some parchment.

"Well, the idea was that it all goes down the tube as one unit" he started, taking some parchment, placing it above the tube's end, gently stuffing it down with a finger, before he pulled it up again.
In his hand he now had parchment with folds perfect to the tube's hole.

"If we put powder at the bottom, the explosive ball on the top, and seal it all with the parchment, that could slide right down the tube.
Afterwards we can prick a hole into the side of the unit once it is inside the tube, put the fuse in there, and it should keep it in place".

He looked at his master, to the parchment, and back to Yurgunn. 
"... I hope" he added somewhat uncertain.

If it wasn't for the height difference between the two, Yurgunn would have tilted her head forward, with an eyebrow raised to give him 'that' look, but instead she shook her head twice before adding: 
"A tiny fuse like that won't hold anything."

She inspected the tube again, and continued:
"But if we are just makin' somethin' for test purpose, this would do tha' trick.
Besides - it would be way too expensive, if yeh' needed to buy a tube each time. 
But the twins gotta crack tha' nut themselves."

She looked to Adrex.
"Should I heat up the forge, so we can have this pipe sealed, then we drill a hole afterwards?"

Scratching his chin wondering how he missed the problem flipping the tube, he nodded, and continued measuring the powder.

___

10 minutes later the temperature in the workshop had risen quite some, and Adrex had mixed what his recipe had specified.
He now had a small bowl full of black powder, which left every surface covered in the charcoal ingredient's black dust.

From the forge flowed a steady heat, and the satisfied dwarf stood holding a tube with a seal end in a tong, with a smile as wide as she could.

"Tha' shou' do it, Adri'!" she exclaimed, as she dipped it into a bucket of water to cool it down, hot steam rising into the air.

Adrex had found the drill, and was ready to drill as Yurgunn placed the tube to the table.
Slowly turning the handle, not applying too much pressure, he carefully drilled into the side of the tube.

"Alright" Adrex said, nodding a bit to himself as the drill made it through to the center.
"Now we just need some powder inside".

"How much powder do we start with?"

Adrex opened his mouth without speaking.
He hadn't given this a lot of thought.
Yurgunn continued:

"And A' take we're go'n to fire it outside?
Whatever we load into it will come blast'n out, and tha's not gonna be inside this shop!"

More nods from Adrex, and he prepared a few charges with different amounts of powder, noting them all on a paper in his notebook.

As they went outside to the shop's back, which was nothing more than an open plain, Adrex brought a modified hourglass, which had several indications marked on the side, a larger hole for sand to flow through, and a slider to stop the sand from running.
Their shop had space around it, and since no one was in the vicinity, they might as well test it here.

Handing the modified hourglass to Yurgunn, and taking the smallest of the prepared samples, he loaded it into the tube, and readied himself with the tube in his hands pointing straight up in the skies.

"Start the timer when you hear the puff, and stop it when you see the ball hit the ground", Adrex said to Yurgunn who just gave him nod, readying the the slider on the device.

Heat is enough to ignite -->

As Adrex loaded the fuse into the tube, a nervous chill ran through his spine - he really hoped this wasn't too much powder for the first attempt.
Igniting the fuse, he closed the eye closest to, held the tube to the air, pointing it as orthogonal as he could to the ground, and prepared himself for a huge blast, which might could-

*fuhhh*

The tube gave a tuck downwards, away from the opening, as a cloud of black smoke blew from it into the air, but not followed by the blast of a cannon at all, but more like...

*duk*

The ball landed not even a second later at the ground close by.
As Adrex opened his closed eye, he could see the ball lay close, only a few feet away.

*That wasn't long*, he thought to himself, as Yurgunn had started looking at the markings on the hourglass.
She soon after joined in: "Let's say tha' was a starting point, shall we?"

Adrex leaned in to inspect the tube at its end.
Sod covered the open end, and as he ran a finger over the edge of it, it felt a bit hotter than before at the very tip of it.
*It should last another shot, for sure*, he thought to himself.

Adrex turned his head towards Yurgunn.
"Well, they only get bigger from here, so lets see what happens.
But I have to put them on the ground - I can't hold them steady with the tuck it makes."

Yurgunn scratched her chin a bit.
"Perhaps we cou' use tha' rack for the maps? 
Eh' points upward, and eh' won' tumble from a wee bit o' shake."
<!-- Blast out, and it tilts just before a shot.
Adrex places himself on top of it, and feels the full blast of the barrel.
"It doesn't shake much, but if I could just hold it steady..." -->


Adrex held the tube in front of him, measuring in his head whether the tube would fit in the rack, and started nodding as he came to the same conclusion.

Fetching it, placing it leveled on the ground, they continued to load larger and larger charges, as the metal ball flew higher and higher each time.
Noting down the time it took for the ball to travel from the takeoff until it hit again, they could properly calculate how far up it had been later on.

As the last charge went off, Adrex kept looking up into the air at nothing in particular, whilst Yurgunn wrote down the last time stamp.
This had almost been too easy - the twins just had to make sure the balls of colorful explosives would go off at the right time, and they could sell this as a new kind of product.
How come no one ever had thought of this before?
Well, they still needed to look at the numbers, and they still needed some sort of formula to calculate the actual height, but that couldn't bee too hard, could it?

As his master closed the notebook, she gave Adrex a small nudge at his hip.
"Yeh' went day dreaming, Adri'.
Wha's on yeh' mind?"

"I can't help but think we are doing something wrong", he said looking down at the dwarf.
"We took a few things, put them together, and now we have..." gesturing with a hand to the tube.
"... whatever this is."

Yurgunn held the modified hourglasses up in front of her.
"Yeh' remember when we made this beauti'?
We came up with a way t' measure seconds in an one minute hourglass - all because we had some creative think'n between us, and we weren't shy t' put existing stuff t'gether.
And that served us very well over the last few years, I'd say."

Indeed it had.
With some smaller hourglasses they had come up with a method, so they could mark the amount of sand in the one minute hourglass second by second.
Having this had given them options for create some very interesting traps over time which had paid off pretty good.

"So - wha's next?" she said, as she started walking to the workshop.

"Well, the time it takes to get up is the same it takes to come down, I think."
Adrex picked up the rack and the tube, which surprisingly still was cold.
"If we can figure out how long it takes for something to fall from a certain distance, we might have the last clues we need to make a formula."

"We cou' get some rope, put measuring flags on it, drop a ball from different heights, and measuring th' time it takes to hit th' ground?"

"Mm - good idea.
We need someplace high for this - like a hundred feet tall, or more, and we need to be able to drop a ball from multiple points along the way."

They walk to the door in silence, thinking about where they could do that.

"How tall is th' house yeh' folk live in, Adri'?"

Entering the workshop, the dragonborn just shook his head.
"Not tall enough. 
Not more than 30 or 35 feet, I think.
Do you think the metal apartments at the Upper Tier are taller?"

"Meh, I doubt it, lad."

As they entered Yurgunn suddenly exclaimed: 
"Of cause - we use th' lift!"

A bit surprised he hadn't thought of it himself, he injected: 
"They will never let us use it."

The lift was used only for the very rich of the Upper Tier, and everyone else was directed to use the stairs.

"They will never let us use eh' for free, yeh' mean"
his master countered.
"We have some coin to spare, remember?"

"You want to bribe a Crownsguard?"

"I intend to bribe all four of 'em" she replied in a mischievous tone.
"Most o' the day, they just stand around, waiting for fancy-ass guest to arrive, allowing a sightseeing or two when they come to inspect their precious production.
They have time, and I'm pretty sure they also like the coin."

Adrex wasn't so sure this was a good idea, but currently he didn't have a better alternative.
Using the lift was actually a pretty good idea, and it could reduce the time this small side quest would take.

Inside the shop Adrex set the tools back at their dedicate spaces, and went looking for some objects they could use.
They didn't have balls lying around to throw from high places.
Roaming around he did find a sandbag, and with some smaller bags they had laying around he filled up 10 of these, sealing them with a small string.

Yurgunn had found some paper slips, and marked each of them with '10 feet', '20 feet', and so forth. 
"Yeh' ready?" she asked, looking like she was already on her way out the door.

Putting the small bags in a satchel along with his notebook, Adrex picked up their hourglass device, nodded, and went along with his master out the door.

Stopping by a shop for buying a 100 feet of rope, they started measuring out 10 feet at a time, and inserted the paper slips with some string to the rope.

As they headed towards the lift, Yurgunn turned to Adrex.

"Just to be sure" she started.
"One o' us takes th' lift up, takes the rope along, and makes sure its end can reach the bottom of the lift.
For each 10 feet, a sandbag is flipped over the edge, and the time it takes to travel will be measured - is tha' correct?"

Adrex nodded, as they approached.
"Should I take the lift, or do you want to?"

"We'll be needed a certain amount of charm to keep the guards happy.
If yeh' don't mind me saying, A' think it might be best if A' took it up?"

It was a reminder to quite a few times where Adrex had really tried to be charming, and it fell flat on the ground, almost shattering potential new contracts.

"Well, when you say it like that..." he responded, a bit embarrassed though still agreeing. 
He really wanted to try the lift, but it wasn't a big deal.
The sight was as good on the top anyway, so it was only really for the experience.

As they reached the lift, four Crownsguard stood watch in their vermilion robes, bronze scale mail breast and arm plates, and each with a weapon at one side, and a crossbows on their other side or back.
Two of the gnomish guards was eating from a small piece of paper, while the two Dwarvish guards sat quietly looking around, as one of them saw the partners approach.

"How can I help yeh' two?" the beard bellowed out, as he stood from his seat.

Yurgunn took a step in front of Adrex, as she curled one of her braids in a finger.
"I was hopin' I could take lift up today."
Walking a a bit closer to the guard, she tilted her her head a bit forward, trying to make puppy eyes.
"I need to carry some sandbags up, and they are awfully heavy."

With only the smallest of pauses, the guard responded with some regret:
"Sorry, miss - I can't let yeh' do tha'." 
He was used to this.
But that didn't mean Yurgunn gave up.

Keeping up the charming voice, and curling some hair behind her ear, she took out a small purse with 20 gold pieces and rang it ever so faintly in front of the guard.
"What if you and the boys got a bit extra for it?"

The guard made a small pause while he looked at the purse, before glancing back to the three others, who apparently had heard the clinging from the purse as well.
"Tha' wouldn't be a bribe of a Crownsguard, now would it, miss?" he asked, one eyebrow raised.

Raising her voice slightly, she replied with some confidence:
"It would be a donation of... I assume... a weeks work for each and all of you."

None of them spoke.
They were considering it.

Before they could refuse she added:
"And if yeh' are asked why yeh' raised it, you can say you wanted to make sure it was still working.
No one have been using this for at least a week."

If the guard ever had had any will to say 'no' to gold, it was now long gone.
He turned to look at his comrades, who had hungry looks in their eyes, and suddenly started twitching their heads a bit, making small motions with their eyes and eyebrows.
It reminded Adrex of the twins, who had communicated in a similar fashion in which he wasn't sure he had those capabilities.
Did he and Yurgunn have it as well, or did they just always say what they thought?
He wasn't sure.

The guard next to Yurgunn looked at the lift for a second.
"Ay - we can't have it not working. 
Better..." he held out his hand, as Yurgunn passed the purse to him.
"... better see if it still works."

He slid the purse inside a pocket, before he gave a nod to to the other three.
"Warmspine - it's yeh' watch for this hoist.
Yeh' know the drill."

The other Crownsguard dwarf gave a nod, as he walked off the lift, and rested on a large rock next to the platform.

Yurgunn turned around to Adrex and gave him a wink as she walked on the platform with the other guards.
"Yeh' won't mind if I toss some of these down to my partner, would yea'?" she asked the Crownsguard dwarf.

"We usually explain to the civilians using the lift, tha' falling off it is their own fault.
Stand on the edge at yeh' own risk, but A' should warn you, that it's a bit shaky" he said, as he walked to a thin line Adrex hadn't noticed before now, and tucked it twice. 
Shortly after the lift started to rise with audible noise.

Adrex took out the hourglass, and readied his pen for his notebook, as he watched the 100-feet rope's end dangle just above the ground.
10 feet later Yurgun called out, Adrex flipped the hourglass, and shortly after a sandbag hit the ground next to the end of the rope.
Inspecting the marks on the hourglass, he noted a number in his book, and flipping the hourglass back.

10 feet later, the same thing happened, though the sandbag seemed to hit a bit closer to Adrex... a bit too close for his liking, and it sounded like it had hit the ground hard.
Noting the time, Adrex moved himself closer to where the guard sat, obviously pondering what the two partners were up to.

He barely got into a sitting position before Yurgunn yelled at the 30-feet mark, sending another sandbag towards the hard surface, and this time tearing a hole through it as the sand inside it tore a weak point open.

The guard cleared his throat a bit, as he scratched in his beard.
"So, what are yeh' two doing, if one may ask?"

Adrex needed to focus, so he didn't look away from the platform which seemed to reach its 40 meter mark.

"We are measuring how long it takes for a sandbag to fall a certain distance" Adrex said staring in the air, as the 40-feet yell was heard, and he flipped the hourglass, heard the sandbag shatter at the ground, and flipped the hourglass again.

"And we measure for each 10 feet, with the small markers telling us when to toss a bag" he continued, as he marked the number, and looked to the platform again.

The guard nodded, as he looked to the dangling rope.
"But eh - does tha' work, when the rope is not touching the ground?" he said, pointing to the end, which hovered two feet above.

Adrex cursed inside.
He hadn't been paying attention to it.
"YURGUNN - GIVE IT MORE ROPE!" he called out to his mentor.

A head poked out, but quickly vanished again.
More rope was added, although a bit too much.
Before he could yell to have her correct it, she yelled back for the 50-feet mark.

Adrex hadn't written it down before the guard asked again, a bit casual:
"So, yeh' are from Talinstadt, I take?"

Adrex froze in his place as a lot of memories surged over him.
Not of the place of Talinstadt, but of who lived there, and what his parents and uncle had told him to do if ever asked about it, or confronted by their citizen.

*Don't deny who you are - just hide it*.

"N-no, I'm..." Adrex had to swallow before he could continue.
"I live in this city, and I grew up here." 

The dwarf was now curious.
"But yeh' are from Draconia, ain't yeh'?"

Adrex had never seen the city itself, as he was still in its egg when the magic that held the floating city aloft had been undone, sending the entire city to the ground, and shattering everything that had ever stood... At least that was what he had been told.

"Well... my parents moved from Draconia many years ago, and I was born here."

Another yell from the 60-feet mark.
Adrex almost missed it, as yet another sandbag fell like the city of Draconia, leaving nothing recognizable from its original form but dust and torn strips of the cloth that held it together.
Just a single push, and hard work to create the sandbag was undone in mere seconds.

He wasn't sure he had got the time right on this one, as he jotted the number down in his notes.

"But aren't yeh' a Ravenite?" asked the Crownsguard a bit confused.

A fast comparison came to mind:
"As much as you are a Duergar" Adrex responded too fast, regretting it even faster.

The face of the dwarf grew hard and his eye got cold, as he raised himself from the rock with his hand on the shaft of his sword.

"A' don't think tha' coin purse was heavy enough such a comment" came the reply in a tense and monotone voice.

*Why can't you keep your mouth shut, Adrex?* he thought to himself.
It had really been a fair comparison for all intense and purpose, but it had not been the right company to make it in.
The Duergar dwarfs had gray skin and lived under the ground, while their cousins of the hills and mountains had a more colorful skin like humans and lived above ground... And they were mortal enemies.
The Ravenite dragonborns looked like the Skywalker dragonborns except the for the lack of tail, and the Ravenites hated Skywalkers with a burning passion.

"Look, I-I'm..." Adrex started before he was cut off.

"A' think you better take a walk, citizen of Hupperdook.
No disturbing of the Crownsguard on duty."
The words were so precise they could have cut stones, and punctuated by the 70-feet sandbag hitting the ground.
Adrex had not even noticed the yell from Yurgunn.

Adrex had no interest in staying - this could not be salvaged, not even with coin.
As he raised himself from the ground the dwarf looked at the place the sandbags had fallen, quickly took on of the intact ones, and threw it at Adrex.

"And take yeh' shit with yeh', yeh' bloody refugee!"

Adrex caught the sandbag as it came hurling towards him, and started running as fast as he could towards the stairs to the Upper Tier.

*This is all my fault, for not keeping my big mouth shut*, he cursed mentally.
*If I had just made the reference to any other race, or just some materials, I would have been perfectly fine, but no - you had to compare them to the most obvious in the context*.

He ran as fast as he could, until he was a good 100 feet from the lift's connection to the Lower Tier, before he slowed down to a fast walk.

"GAH" Adrex spat as he started the walk up the steps.
It was the dwarfs own fault.
Why didn't he know about the relationship the Skywalkers and the Ravenites had to each other?
The dwarf would just have said 'oh', and perhaps dropped the subject like a hot potato, but for some reason he didn't know about the slavery that had ended 20 years ago when Draconia fell.
The dwarf would also have gathered Adrex was born after that event, and he had absolutely no stakes in that matter, but being on the wrong side of the table.

Adrex continued up the stairs, fuming, hissing, and snarling the entire way, as he held the sandbag, hourglass, and notebook in his arms.

*And the experiment failed, because I didn't think it through.
Of cause Yurgunn needed to make sure the rope was just touching the ground when she tossed a sandbag, but how could she without falling off that damn lift?*

Now he had to come up with a new way to measure the time, and he only had a single sandbag left.
*How long does it take for a sandbag to fall, how long does it take, how long does it take?*

When he got up to the top he would take the leftover sandbag, tie the rope around it and let it hang until it...
*Wait - that's it*, he thought to himself.
*Tie a bag to the end, and drop it.
Drop it 10 feet, then 20 feet, then...* 

He forgot all about the Crownsguard and Talinstadt. 
Why hadn't he thought of this earlier?

It didn't take him long before he reached the top of the stairs.
His head was buzzing with how he would perform the test, how to tie the sandbag so it didn't tore when the rope reached its full length - it would be perfect.

As he took the last steps to the Upper Tier, he was greeted by another angry dwarf, most likely just as unpleasant as the last one, but this one he could talk with.

"Wha' the fuck happened down there?" his master exclaimed.
"A' hadn't been gone for two minutes, before A' see him throwing a sandbag after yeh'.
How did yeh' manage tha' result?"

Adrex took a deep breath.
"He asked if I was from Talinstadt", as if that was explanation enough.
And it was.
Yurgunn mood changed from frustrated to worried and serious.

"And wha' did yeh' say to make him tha' angry?" she followed up.

"Well, he asked if I was a Ravenite, and I..." 
Adrex would have lifted his hands if they wasn't filled with items.
"I compared them to dwarfs and Duergars, which I really shouldn't..." 

"No, you should not have" she interrupted him, the anger back in her voice, as she strode towards him, fist clenched.
As she reached him she flung her arms around his waist, and held him... fast, but gently.

"A' love yeh', Adri'" she said with a soft voice.
"But you have got to start learning people skills."

A whimpering sound came from the dragonborn, as the notebook fell from his arms, followed by the sandbag, and the hourglass, before his knees gave in under him, and he slumbered to the ground.
It had been a really long day, and he wasn't sure he could handle more mood swings.
