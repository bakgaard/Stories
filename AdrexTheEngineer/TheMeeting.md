# Chapter X

Adrex was panting hard for air.
His wound didn't make it any easier, but the half-elf finally laid still... or at least, she wasn't putting up a fight anymore, cause it looked like she was trying to just not pass out.
Not that he had any intentions of letting her.
He needed answer, and no way would he let her pass before he had gotten them.

He dropped his empty gun on the bramble of the tree he had taken cover behind, before he slowly stumbled his way towards her, one step at the time, still clutching his ribs that had lost scales in a straight line.
He wouldn't die of it, he was sure, but it could get infected if he didn't do something about it soon.
But that time was not now - it was time for answers of the past few weeks' senseless attacks from her.

Taking another step towards her sent a shot of pain through his ribcage.

*Note to self: don't place too much weight on the left side*, he thought to himself, as the anger slowly started to build.
He could taste the poison he produced in his mouth, that apparently had started to leak.
It wasn't nice, but neither was what he was about to do to her.

Another step; less painful this time, as he continued towards her, his focus like a the blaze from fireworks going up.
As she laid there, half focused on the bullet wound in her guts, she sent glances towards him - not of hate, but of fear.

*Good*, he thought to himself.
*Fear is rather justified right now*.

A small grin could properly be seen on his face right now, if there was anyone to see it in this ruined landscape.
The wind blew his cape up to the side as he cracked his fingers, readying his claws for something he had never done, but really wanted to for a long time.

"I said..." he started, before he had to cough twice, "-why of Tiamat's first plane of Hell do you keep chasing me?"

He was just about to swipe at her, as another voice sounded from behind him:
"You sound like you need some **manners**!"

Adrex' head snapped directly behind him, where three individuals had... stepped out of... the tree?
Although he wanted to keep his focus on them, it was way more pressing to keep his eyes on the iron bands that came flying towards him.
He tried to shield himself with his left hand, but this wasn't just a net that was tossed at him.
The bands wrap themself around his arm, before they continued to entangle his torso, which sent a wave of pain through him, sending him to his knees.
And the bands kept encasing his entire body as never ending bandages; 
His arms got locked in place, his legs got bound to each other, his head twisted straight, and his snout tightly wrapped tight to his jaw.
A short second later he tilted to the side, landing hard on his left side, facing the girl.

A fury grew in Adrex' mind, like a seething, red, expanding dot.
He was *so* close to getting the answers out of this girl.
She was no more than an arm's reach away from him.
But perhaps he could anyway.

He slowly inhaled, as the taste became evermore present in his mouth, before it slowly started to bellow out of his mouth.
As he exhaled as hard as he could, the venomous gas started to fill the space around his head, blowing out where he could open his lips ever so slightly.

"Oh, no - I don't think you do" the male interjected.
He sounded closer to Adrex without Adrex actually able to see him.
A new set of bands snapped all around his mouth, and trapped the gas in his mouth and lounges.

It hurt.
A lot.
And it kept hurting.

This couldn't be it - this couldn't be how he went out. 
Not after all the bullshit he had gone through. 
The world couldn't possible be this unfair!

As his eyes started blur from the water that filled them, two of the individuals had rushed and knelt next to the girl, sparking some sort of light around her.

The last thing he heard was the words "dear - are you alright?".
But they wasn't for him; he was no one's 'dear' anymore.

___

According to Adrex' mother, Bahamut would make sure your afterlife was pleasant.
She had described it as being a floating existence, where all the ones that came before you would greet you, and all the hate you had ever had would be forgiven and mended.
That was what happened when you ascended to the afterlife, because you lived a good and honest life.

Adrex never really asked too much what would happen if you didn't live as such.
How little honesty and good was required to *not* ascend.
But that must have been the case for him, cause everything hurt - that was how he awoke.

Not a slow, blurred awakening - it was a spontaneous slap in his face that did the trick, reawakening all the wounds he had.
His eyes wide open, his mouth trying to gasp for air, but found his teeth still clinched together by the iron bands that had been there before.
The air wasn't the same though - it was... old, moist, warmer, and his gasp had given a slight echo.

His eyes started darting around, though his head was still locked in place, and his arms where now fixed to each side of his head, palms out towards a... dungeon?
Torches lid up the place ever so slightly, as the white stones in the room formed a new existence for Adrex.
To his right he could see the shape of the girl - all well, without a problem in her stomach, hand stretched out after the backhand lash she had just dealt him to get him back to consciousness.

The male voice from earlier filled the room:
"Thank you, dear.
Let me do the talking from here, please".

It wasn't an evil sounding voice, but it bore a grim tone to it.
It sounded like too much confidence for Adrex' liking.

As his eyes shifted focus, a white haired human halfway through his forties sat on a chair with his legs planted firmly in front of him.
His white shirt underneath his brown vest had a emblem sewn into it, and his hands held... Adrex' gun.

The man inspected it, turned it around, grabbed it firmly by the grip, and held it in a straight arm towards Adrex' left, before taking it in for another closer inspection.
Poking around it, the human also found the way to open it up to quickly study, before his face became *very* grim, and his eyes pieced right into Adrex' own.

"You are Adrex Scalenduur, if I am not mistaken?" he said in a monotone voice, without a hint of compassion or interest.

It surprised Adrex the guy actually knew him, as his eyes pierced around, looking for clues of a way out of this situation.
This white haired human somehow...

*Oh*, Adrex thought to himself, as the realization kicked in.

"Mhh, mhhphh" Adrex hissed out of his sealed mouth.

The human stood up, anger clearly showing across his face.
"If you release just a hint of your poisoning gas, she-" he tilted his head towards someone Adrex couldn't see, "- will put an arrow through your skull before you have breathed your lounges out.
Do I make myself perfectly clear, dragonborn?"

He did, Adrex thought to himself.
This might have been the clearest message he'd ever received.
Did it really matter though?
The girl had tried to kill him for weeks, and now he was... caged in the iron bands, and she could toy with him.
An arrow sounded like a quick death right now.
But it was interesting company he had found himself in, and right now he didn't know who of the three was the most dangerous to him.

The human snapped his finger, and the seal of Adrex' mouth and neck withdrew, allowing him to speak again.
Watering his mouth and teeth, he rephrased his reply:
"Yes, I am."

Adrex took a glance around to see another half-elf female with long black hair - an adult, and a spiked bow already loaded standing ready in the shadow, her face not giving away anything but a stern look.
Her clothing was nice and fitted though - almost royal.
But that confirmed it.

Adrex continued before the human could ask his second question:

"And you must be the parents of this..."
*Uh, choose these words carefully*
"girl, who have been trying to kill me over the past couple of weeks, I take?"

The human tilted his head, now more curious than angry, one eyebrow up, so Adrex went on:
"Based on the way you hold my gun, you know how to use it, which I believe only one individual knows how to." 
Adrex' eyes narrowed.
"- which makes you a member of Vox Machina, if *I* am not mistaken?"

His eyes had only one focus in the world, and that was trying to read this human.
He might hold enough power over his wife and child to keep Adrex alive a bit more.
They were the parents - their hair gave it away, and not even Yurgunn had known how to hold the gun the first time, but this guy did.
Which meant that this was an ugly bet with destiny, since Adrex only ever heard one thing about the Vox Machina, and that was the story old Cleff Tinkertop had told a few months back.
<!-- But this time there had been no theft. -->

Adrex could see a small grin on the human's face, before he pushed his circular spectacles up a nudge with two fingers, still holding Adrex' gun in his other hand.

"You are correct - on both accounts, mr. Scalenduur" he said, putting both hands behind his back, standing firm in front of his prisoner.
"For the record - my name is Lord Percival de Rolo the Third of Whitestone.
Do you know why we sent her?"

There was a moment of silence, while the dragonborn's eyes searched his memories.
Adrex actually didn't know, even though he had questioned himself that many times over the past two weeks.
He had ideas, but they sounded ridiculous when he went over them.
He couldn't be for wealth - these guys looked like they had everything they needed, both in terms of equipment and magic - they could have everything they wanted.
Did they hate highborns? 
Nah, he and his family had never done anything to any other dragonborns, and there would surely have been a ravenite gloating in here if that was the case.
It couldn't be to get secrets out of him of how a certain trap he had constructed could be bypassed - he wouldn't be alive to tell it.
So that left what he had done, and the biggest "crime" he could think of, was a deal he had made with the Krynn, and constructing the mobile trap, that had turned into...

Adrex' eyes went from confusion to almost disbelief, as he looked back to the lord in front of him.
"My guns?" he said, not really wanting to believe it.

The girl suddenly chimed in: 
"Dingeling - he got it!" she exclaimed with a heavy sarcasm.

*Why would they go after me?
I'm not part of anything they have done!*

"But I made them!" Adrex injected.
"I came up with them!"

"You came up with nothing, mr. Scalenduur", Percival countered.
"You might have made your own tweaks and modifications, but I most certainly guarantee you, you did not invent this monstrosity!"

He raised Adrex' gun which he held over its barrel and trigger - Adrex knew it was empty for bullet, and the Lord of Whitestone properly did too. <!-- A bit vague -->

"The only thing you came up with, was a way for the Krynn Dynasty to rage war upon the rest of its continent, if not the entire Prime Material Plane!" <!-- Add emotion description -->
This most certainly had pulled a nerve with him.

"When these things came into existence, I struck a deal with a shadow demon, and the only thing these brought was pain and misery."
He knelt down right in front of Adrex' face, before he hissed at Adrex.
"Unless a certain Orthax is hiding within you, I'd guess you heard about these creations, and found a way to make them yourself for your own good."

This somehow struck closer to home than Adrex would have expected.
His gaze fell down at nothing in particular.
He had struck a deal, and the gun and the rifle was made for his own good, but only as a mean to escape.

Percival continued studying the dragonborn's face.
"It seems like I got close to the truth there, didn't I?
And when you finally made this, you went of to sell it to the highest bidder, hm?
Not considering the outcome of what would happen."

"I did" Adrex half replied, half countering.

"Just as I thought" replied the Lord of Whitestone, as he stood up from his crouched position.
He gesturing towards the half-elf in the shadow, that started pull her bowstring.

*What? 
I just said... oh for Bahamut's sake!*

"I *did* consider the consequences, and I had also struck a deal!"
It came out a bit harsh, but time was of the essence if he was not to end up dead.

Lord de Rolo stopped in his movement, as he held up a finger to pause the execution.
"Oh, it wasn't so much as *if* you considered it, but whether your intentions were good."
He turned around slowly.

"See, my daughter has a very special item with her, that allows her to quickly teleport back to its counterpart.
This item I keep with me at all times when she is on a mission."

He reached for a coat hanging over a chair he had been sitting on, and pull out a small piece of metal.

*Is that a used bullet?
Oh, not good*, Adrex thought to himself, as he swallowed.

"You see, when she uses this item, it takes a second before the effect kicks in, and when the only thing I see coming back is the remains of something that looks like my own bullets, I do not hesitate to take action.
For fragments like these..." he held it up for inspection, pausing a bit, before his eyes narrowed down in Adrex' and continued:
"-should not exist anywhere I am not".

He crouched down in front of Adrex again so their heads were leveled.
"My friends and I have means to get around in this world, and do so extremely fast. 
Locating my beloved daughter tasks no time, and finding a place to get to her takes only slightly longer."

Percival's voice became even colder and almost a whisper, as he continued:
"And when the first thing I see, emerging from the portal, is a dragonborn lying over my Vesper, claws out, ready to strike, praying to Tiamat, then it was only because I was dead set I could restrain you before you stroke, that I didn't shoot you dead on the spot."

He twisted his fingers slightly, and the ironbands slowly started to tighten harder, squeezing Adrex to a painful state, to which Adrex' starterd to groan in pain:
"I... I didn't... pray to... " 
He had to use all his will to say the last part, as the bands tightened around his chest, shoulders, arms, and legs. 
"... To Tiamat".

"You know" the human retorted.
"You are not the first dragonborn I've come across who had dealings with Tiamat.
When we defeated the demigod Vecna about 20 years ago, we had help from another dragonborn, who was pretty keen set on bringing Tiamat back to this plane.
I cannot help but wonder, if we just have a bad record with your kind, or there's something to it."

Still not easing the iron bands, Adrex felt no less pain, as he stumbled for words:
"I was... cursing... not pray- aaarhh... praying."
He had started gasping for air, as his left side of his ribcage sent pain flowing through him.

Adrex needed a way out of this, and he needed it fast.
If he spew his poison gas, the half-elf lady would shoot him with an arrow, and the Lord of Whitestone would properly do the same with a bullet, before crushing him with the iron bands.

What did he have to bargain with?
His life? it seemed worthless to them.
Something smooth to say? Even if he could think of something, he was in no state of actually say the words.
That left him with information they wanted.

"The designs..." he gasps, hoping this would at least spark an interest.

The girl, Vesper, injected faster than he got any further:
"Your scroll got stolen by a Krynn, so now they know everything!"

It would take the Krynn too long to understand the content of it, cause Adrex didn't want the notes to fall into their hands.

"En... crypted..."

*Arrrhhh, it hurts everywhere!*

Suddenly the bands loosened ever so slightly, as the Lord of Whitestone grabbed his jaw, and turned it towards him.

"Encrypted what?" he asked sternly.

Heaving air into his lounges as fast as he could, Adrex tried to regain some focus.

"SPEAK!" Percival demanded.

"The scroll..." Adrex started, taking another shaking breath "... was written with an encryption.
You can't read it... without the keystone."

Percival released his grip, and Adrex' previous state of panic slowly faded, as a more focus self took over his train of thoughts, before he continued:
"Or at least they won't for a while."

There was silence in the room, but for Adrex still taking some audible breaths, trying to calm himself down.

*It worked? 
They are not killing me?*

The Lord of Whitestone rose to his feet, pinching his eyebrows over the ridge of his nose.

The half-elf lady suddenly uttered her first word: 
"Darling?"

Her husband held up his other hand's index finger, as a sign to pause the upcoming question, before he asked one himself:
"You say there is a keystone translate it?"

*Well, I didn't escape entirely.*

"Yes" Adrex said, more focused and calm, though he was still restrained.
"But they don't know yet, so they will properly come back for me."

The a horrible realization went through him.
*It's not just me they will come back for - Yurgunn!*

He looked up with a horrified expression to the human.
"We have to get that scroll back - if not they will go after my master, and try to get the key from her."

"Agree" Percival said rather calm.
"We do indeed need to get it from them, but what is the keystone to decrypting the scroll?"

"It's a book, but please - if they see this hindrance, they will not hesitate to-" Adrex continued before was interrupted again.

"Which book?" Percival asked again, his tone slightly annoyed.

"They can get to her within an hour, because they-"

It went so fast Adrex almost didn't understand what he was looking at.
While he had been making his gun, he had multiple times looked into the barrel for cleaning and polishing, but never had he seen such a beautiful barrel stuck right up in face... which he then realized was the very last thing he might ever see.

"WHICH BOOK!?" the Lord of Whitestone roared to him, standing with his own gun to Adrex' forehead.

*That can't possibly be more important than saving a life?
Why is he so hyped about decrypting it?*

Adrex hesitated a second too long for Percival, who then lifted the barrel and placed it on Adrex' head, which followed a blast that did not leave any hair on Adrex' head, if he had had any.
The sound didn't come before a heatwave had left the barrel, pressing his scale to his cranium with the immense force that left the tip of Percival's gun.
The split second after Adrex' heart skipped a beat, he suddenly realized he was way too close to the receiving end of the gun barrel.
The barrel rested on top of Adrex' head, now suddenly very warm, and the pain on top of his head was excruciating for a second or two, before it cooled to merely warm.

But Adrex' widespread eyes must have been exactly what his interrogator had wanted to see, though it wasn't a smile that curled up on his face, but more of a relief one person has after trying to explain something, and the receiving party finally gets it.
Percival stowed away his own gun, as he kneeled down to the dragonborn again, his face more grim than irritated.

"It's not that I hate you, mr. Scalenduur, it's because I hate what you made."

*I made something like what you made*, Adrex thought but didn't say out loud, before Percival continued.

"When I created this weapon, I was in a very bad place, and the only thing I wanted was hurting a specific amount of people.
That is what they are good for."
He held a small pause, as he let the words sink in.

"What you have made, mr. Scalenduur, is the same thing, just by the look of it, and the tales from my daughter.
I don't know if you hated someone as well, but this cannot be released to the rest of the world.
If it ever saw the hand of any organization, be that a small group of people, a faction, or even an army, the world would change, and not for the better."

Adrex was starting to sweat ever so slightly.
There might be something he should leave out of a upcoming response.

"... so when I ask about which book that can decrypt this message, it's because I care more about the rest of the society than about a single individual.
I hope you can understand that."
His tone then shifted to a more friendly one:
"With that said, I will see if I can get her to safety as well, but I need to know which book holds the key."

Adrex swallowed.
This was properly his last chance to get out of this alive if he played his cards right.
He might as well see if Percival would go through with his promise.

"The book is a popular one I found at a library.
It had to be, because I needed a way to decrypt it myself without bringing the book along.
So I went to a book store, and asked for what was popular. 
It could have been poetry, cook books, gardening books - just something that was everywhere.
And I was told a new book had come out, which was cheap, and it was sent to every store in the region..."

"Do tell", Percival said sounding very interested.

"It's called 'Darring Trials and Turbulations of Sir Darrington'. 
I was told it was a fiction book, which-"

He was cut off by Vesper, the girl, who suddenly interjects:
"Isn't that Uncle's new book?"

*No way...*

The Lady of Whitestone had lowered her bow, and had started shaking her head.
"I think we received a few copies from him, if you need one, darling"

Her husband shook his head.
"I don't need it, but the Krynn Empire do." 
His voice went from relieved to troubled.
"And they can easily get one, which means we have got to act fast, but we need to be smart about this."

"Can't you just portal in, and torch it?" Vesper chipped in. 
It apparently didn't sound like too big of an issue to her.

"No, absolutely not" Percival responded in a serious tone.
"If we get recognized - and we will - we would have declared war with an entire empire."

"But they won't know who I am" Vesper countered, firm in her conviction.

"You are not supposed to be seen in the first place, but I fear they will anyway" her father responded, a bit bitter about the situation.
"They have the scroll, and I assume they also know about the keystone?" he said as he turned to Adrex again.

Still wrapped up in the iron bands, the tone had most certainly changed from interrogation to problem solving.
"Ehm..."
Adrex had to think about it for a second.
"No, they never got to see the inside of the scroll, nor know it was encrypted" he replied after a bit of thought.

Percival looked from Adrex to Vesper, back and forth, before he snapped his fingers.
The iron bands started to magically detract themselves, until they only wrapped around Adrex' wrist, where they tied themselves together in front of him, his palms very close together.

"You are coming with us, mr. Scalenduur" Percival said, his back already turned to him, and heading for the only door in the room.

Perplexed about the situation, Adrex stood still for a moment, as the Lord of Whitestone and his daughter left.
He turned his gaze to the Lady of Whitestone, who gave him a stern look, and a nod towards the door, as her fingers softly tapped the string of the bow she held.

*I am coming with you, apparently*, he thought to himself.
His body was still hurting from both the fight and the interrogation, but he would manage.

As he left out through the door, he started wondering if this was better than wondering the ruins of Draconia, and constantly being chased by enemies trying to kill him with unknown motives.
Right now he was caught, but they hadn't killed him, which had to be an better somehow, but he wasn't sure.
He wasn't exactly free to do anything.

Leading him up through several flights of stairs, he caught a glimpse out of a window to a large lake way below the castle he was being held in.
*What a view*, he thought to himself, as the half-elf behind him nudged him onwards.

He arrived in an office with a large desk filled with papers, scrolls, and books piled on, and next, to each other.
The fireplace behind it was lit, and gave a cozy feel to the room, as he saw Vesper drop down into a couch large enough for three people facing the door, rather than the desk.
Percival sat down behind the desk as Adrex entered, gesturing to the couch for him to take a seat, though it was more of a formality, based on his facial expression.

Adrex hesitated again for a second in the doorway, which resulted in a tip of a bow poking him into the room, as the half-elf had no time to wait for Adrex to enter.
She closed the door to the room, as Adrex stood a bit confused to why he was there.
Even though the gesture to sit down was nice, there was a small problem - Adrex had a tail, and he couldn't just curl it up like Artimis could which was why there always was a stool for him... well, almost always.
Glancing around the room for one, he finally saw a huge board on the wall next to the door.
Parchment hung all around with colored linen threads connecting the nails that kept the parchment up.
He took a step closer to inspect it, with his mouth hanging slightly open, as he recognized a sketch of himself... in the middle of it all.

*This is not a safe room to be in*, he thought to himself, as he started looking around at the connections.
Right next to him was a parchment with "Guns", leading to another piece saying just "Me". 
Adrex assumed this must be the Lord of Whitestone.
Another piece from the "Guns" said "Black powder", leading to a piece saying "Firework", leading to "Hupperdook", and back to Adrex.
From "Guns" was a connection to the word "Orthax" - Adrex thought he might have heard that mentioned earlier in the dungeon, which connected to both "Me" and "Adrex".
Then there were connections between "Krynn empire" to "Guns", to "Adrex", to "Hupperdook", connecting to other names Adrex hadn't heard of before.

Percival interrupted Adrex' study:
"Yes, that must seem like a huge conspiracy towards you."
He halted for a second before he added a bit quieter: 
"... which it technically is..."

Adrex turned to face him, rather concerned by it:
"You created the first gun, is that correct?"
He was actually pretty sure about it, but he needed confirmation for his next question.

The Lord of Whitestone folded his fingers in front of his face, elbows resting on the table, his face giving nothing away:
"Yes, I did."

"So you came after me just because I made them as well?"

Percival rested to the back of the seat, as he started explaining, a bit tired though not frustrated:
"I assume you know, that me and my wife-" he nodded to the half-elf "-Vex'ildan, were part of Vox Machina about 20 years ago.
Back then we did everything that the world required of us, because someone had to do it.
We took out evil entities that had occupied other peoples residents on several occasions, rescued important members of high councils, freed Tal'Dorei of The Chroma Conclave which I'm sure you know about-" said more fatter-of-fact.
And Adrex sure had - that was the entire reason for his family being in Hupperdook, and all their xenophobic habits.

"We did get some time for ourself at some point after that, but you are never really 'off duty' when you first save the continent ones.
I spend a good half a year trying to locate the whereabouts of an old enemy, who had stolen my designs, and started distributing it to her followers.
And when I finally found her, she had already made plans of selling it to the highest bidder" <!-- Verify this -->

Percival lowered his fingers to the table, as his eyes bore into Adrex'.
"Please do understand, that my designs were never meant to make anything better in this world.
They were only meant for revenge, which I got when I finally pinned her to the ground to not rise again."

Adrex had to swallow before he tried his sentence:
"I am sorry she stole them from you, but I didn't really know you existed when I invented my design."

The stare-off lasted for another three seconds, before Percival looked down into the table, and mutter:
"No, you properly didn't."

He stood up slowly from his seat, and started walking around the table towards the board and the cuffed Adrex.
"But I am sure, that you understand the thread *our* designs pose to all people and creatures in this world.
And being the creator of something this powerful, we have a certain responsibility to ensure, that it does not fall into the hands of the wrong people."

He reached the board, and started touching a few of the parchment pieces.
"Do fill me in, though I think I know the gist of most of these" he started, before he added "-please".

It couldn't hurt, could it?
He was at the Lord of Whitestone's mercy anyway, and if he could slay dragons, he had absolutely no problem slaying a cuffed dragonborn.
Adrex might as well...

Percival continued, seeing no objection from Adrex:
"I first found out something was amiss when I visited my supplier of black powder, who lives in Hupperdook" he started, pointing to piece reading 'Rocket of Sparkles and Glitter', which Adrex first now recognized - the twins' store.
"The two granddaughters of the dear Victor had come up with a new way to send up rockets - they had made pipes that shot them up.
It didn't take more than a smile and a kind compliment, before they told me a local tinker had come up with it, though they wouldn't tell who.
Didn't take long to find the closet tinker shop, which had way too many clocks and gadgets lying around, and the..." he skimped around the board "... Tinkertop, I think, was kind enough to tell me, that he didn't work with powder."
A smile on his right side of his face showed.
"But he told me you did some work with it, mr. Scalenduur."

Adrex remembered Cleff Tinkertop rather well in this very moment.
He was the one, who had warned him about Vox Machina in the first place, and who had made Adrex take extra precautions, though apparently not enough.

"Did he recognize you, when you met him?" Adrex asked a bit quick and worried.

The lord shot up an eyebrow, though he did reply: 
"No, I doubt neither of us had ever seen each other before.
Any chance he should know me?"

Adrex had turned back to the board.
Cleff had been the one telling him about how Vox Machina had tracked down the thief, and left only tales about it.
Whether or not it had been Vox Machina's intentions, it had certainly had the effect they had hoped for.

"He did mention your group at some point" Adrex started.
"It was just the story of you, but it seemed rather... unbelievable."
He made another short pause before injecting: "-with the demogod and all."

"Yes, the rise of Vecna" Percival said a bit grim.
"I know this is a far shot, but do you know of a red-scaled dragonborn called Arkhan the Cruel?"

Adrex had never heard of him, and just shook his head.
An 'oh well' expression showed briefly on the human's face. 
"Didn't expect you to, but you do show up where I don't want you to.
Like you showed up outside the Xhorhasian Empire's capital with a scroll specifying how to take over the world by forces not meant to be wielded by the world".

"It wasn't like I had a choice" Adrex countered.
"I had signed a - what I found out later - magical contract, so I have to comply with it.
I even found a loophole out of-", but the Lord of Whitestone cut him off.

"I care little about whatever loophole you think you found" in a dead serious tone.
"You, mr. Scalenduur, care about very few things in this world, and since you *think* you found a loophole, I can already tell you, that it will not cut it."
From his desk he grasped a piece of paper, and held it so Adrex could see it; it was the contract signed by Adrex.

*How is this possible?*
*If he has this he must have been...*
Adrex' gaze spun to the board again, locating all the strings from his parchment, and followed the lines until he found the one he was looking for.
He dared not think it, as he reached for the parchment with his master's name on it.
"What does the little line in the top-right corner mean?" he asked in a both tense and worried question.

Percival turned back to his desk, as he reached for something at his waist.
"A cross in the top-right corner means they are dead" he said calmly, sending an intense shimmer down Adrex' spine, before he continued:
"And half of that - one line - means I have captured them."

He had reached the opposite site of his desk, as the lord's gun again pointed towards Adrex.
"I read your contract, and the notes you made about encrypting it, but when I tell you that it will still not get you out of it, I might as well tell you what you will do when you find out."
His voice had become cold and grim yet again.

Adrex was fighting back an urge to unleash whatever venomous gas he could, but now it would also cost the life of Yurgunn.
Was she here?
Was she unharmed?

"You look at me as threatening as you want, dragonborn, but that will not change the outcome.
And before you ask - no, she has not been harmed" he said rather convincing, but at that moment Vesper turned her head to look away, which was plenty to tell that was not the case. 
Adrex looked towards her, Percival followed Adrex' eyes to his daughter, before he sighted and followed:
"- a lot, but she is fine.
We just had some questions we needed answer to".
Vesper tried to vet her lips, but it was way too obvious it was to cover another expression.

Adrex' eyes flew back to human:
"You have healing powers in your arsenal, if I am not mistaken?"

A smile flashed on the Lord of Whitestone' face, and a small head tilt recognizing why the question was asked.
"Yes, it's a very efficient way to torture you victims, if I should say so myself." 
His smirk went away again as he continued:
"So with the cards on the table, I might as well tell you what is going to happen, mr. Scalenduur.
You are going to your friends in the Xhorhasian Empire, and you are going to destroy that scroll before they find out how to read what's inside it.
Because your contract is not fulfilled before you've actually given them everything you promised - without encryption.
And you will be going alone, though we will certainly follow your every move.
And when that is done, your master will be set free, just like you will be free from us."

Bound on his hands, with his master's life on the line as well, Adrex didn't have much of a choice.
He was cornered for options, and he had as good as nothing to barging with.
All they wanted was for the scroll to be destroyed before the content was decrypted.
And Adrex didn't want the content in their hands either.
Xhorhas would be military <!--Is this the right word?--> superior if they made guns, and would enslave everyone Adrex cared about;
His family, the twins... the Tinkertops - wait, didn't he like anyone else?
Most of Hupperdook had been assholes to him and his family for almost 20 years, not respecting them just one bit.
How much was he actually loosing... compared to these people.

A grin could be seen emerging on Adrex' face, as his eyes narrowed as he looked to the Lord of Whitestone.
"My master would be free, you say?" Adrex' asked to begin with.

The human's face was unchanged but for a nod.
He must have known Adrex had come up with something.

"Now, that is a good thing. 
Her family will be happy to hear that", as he took a small step to the side, letting the board be seen more freely.
Percival's sight fell to the one spot Adrex had hoped, and as it searched around the one note, Adrex continued explaining:
"Oh, no family to be seen?
The closest thing she has is me - her master died a few years ago."

<!-- Barging about his family is doomed anyway -->

<!-- How will I get away? -->
<!-- I could defect, leaving you with the same problem, just way more eminent -->
<!-- Then I need a bit done before I go in to them -->

<!-- Not our problem -->
