# Chapter X

Adrex was panting hard for air.
His wound didn't make it any easier, but the half-elf finally laid still... or at least, she wasn't putting up a fight anymore, cause it looked like she was trying to just not pass out.
Not that he had any intentions of letting her.
He needed answer, and no way would he let her pass before he had gotten them.

He dropped his empty gun on the bramble of the tree he had taken cover behind, before he slowly stumbled his way towards her, one step at the time, still clutching his ribs that had lost scales in a straight line.
He wouldn't die of it, he was sure, but it could get infected if he didn't do something about it soon.
But that time was not now - it was time for answers of the past few weeks' senseless attacks from her.

Taking another step towards her sent a shot of pain through his ribcage.

*Note to self: don't place too much weight on the left side*, he thought to himself, as the anger slowly started to build.
He could taste the poison he produced in his mouth, that apparently had started to leak.
It wasn't nice, but neither was what he was about to do to her.

Another step; less painful this time, as he continued towards her, his focus like a the blaze from fireworks going up.
As she laid there, half focused on the bullet wound in her guts, she sent glances towards him - not of hate, but of fear.

*Good*, he thought to himself.
*Fear is rather justified right now*.

A small grin could properly be seen on his face right now, if there was anyone to see it in this ruined landscape.
The wind blew his cape up to the side as he cracked his fingers, readying his claws for something he never had done, but really wanted to for a long time.

"I said" he started, before he had to cough twice, "-why of Tiamat's first plane of Hell do you keep chasing me?"

He was just about to swipe at her, as another voice sounded from behind him:
"You sound like you need some **manners**!"

Adrex' head snapped directly behind him, where three individuals had... stepped out of... the tree?
Although he wanted to keep his focus on them, it was way more pressing to keep his eyes on the iron bands that came flying towards him.
He tried to shield himself with his left hand, but this wasn't just a net that was tossed at him.
The bands wrap themself around his arm, before they continued to entangle his torso, which sent a wave of pain through him, sending him to his knees.
And the bands kept encasing his entire body as never ending bandages; 
His arms got locked in place, his legs got bound to each other, his head twisted straight, and his snout tightly wrapped tight to his jaw.
A short second later he tilted to the side, landing hard on his left side, facing the girl.

A fury grew in Adrex' mind, like a seething, red, expanding dot.
He was *so* close to getting the answers out of this girl.
She was no more than an arms reach away from him.
But perhaps he could anyway.

He slowly inhaled, as the taste became evermore present in his mouth, before it slowly started to bellow out of his mouth.
As he exhaled as hard as he could, the venomous gas started to fill the space around his head, blowing out where he could open his lips ever so slightly.

"Oh, no - I don't think you do" the male interjected.
He sounded closer to Adrex without Adrex actually able to see him.
A new set of bands snapped all around his mouth, and trapped the gas in his mouth and lounges.

It hurt.
A lot.
And it kept hurting.

This couldn't be it - this couldn't be how he went out. 
Not after all the bullshit he had gone through. 
The world couldn't possible be this unfair!

As his eyes started blur from the water that filled them, two of the individuals had rushed and knelt next to the girl, sparking some sort of light around her.

The last thing he heard was the words "dear - are you alright?".
But they wasn't for him; he was no one's 'dear' anymore.

___

According to Adrex' mother, Bahamut would make sure your afterlife was pleasant.
She had described it as being a floating existence, where all the ones that came before you would greet you, and all the hate you had ever had would be forgiven and mended.
That was what happened when you ascended to the afterlife, because you lived a good and honest life.

Adrex never really asked too much what would happen if you didn't live as such.
How little honesty and good was required to *not* ascend.
But that must have been the case for him, cause everything hurt - that was how he awoke.

Not a slow, blurred awakening - it was a spontaneous slap in his face that did the trick, reawakening all the wounds he had.
His eyes wide open, his mouth trying to gasp for air, but found his teeth still clinched together by the iron bands that had been there before.
The air wasn't the same though - it was... old, moist, warmer, and his gasp had given a slight echo.

His eyes started darting around, though his head was still locked in place, and his arms where now fixed to each side of his head, palms out towards a... dungeon?
Torches lid up the place ever so slightly, as the white stones in the room formed a new existence for Adrex.
To his right he could see the shape of the girl - all well, without a problem in her stomach, hand stretched out after the backhand lash she had just dealt him to get him back to consciousness.

The male voice from earlier filled the room:
"Thank you, dear.
Let me do the talking from here, please".

It wasn't an evil sounding voice, but it bore a grim tone to it.
It sounded like too much confidence for Adrex' liking.

As his eyes shifted focus, a white haired human halfway through his forties sat on a chair with his legs planted firmly in front of him.
His white shirt underneath his brown vest had a emblem sewn into it, and his hands held... Adrex' gun.

The man inspected it, turned it around, grabbed it firmly by the grip, and held it in a straight arm towards Adrex' left, before taking it in for another closer inspection.
Poking around it, the human also found the way to open it up to quickly study, before his face became *very* grim, and his eyes pieced right into Adrex' own.

"You are Adrex Scalenduur, if I am not mistaken?" he said in a monotone voice, without a hint of compassion or interest.

It surprised Adrex the guy actually knew him, as his eyes started looking for clues out of this situation.
This white haired human somehow...

*Oh*, Adrex thought to himself, as the realization kicked in.

"Mhh, mhhphh" Adrex hissed out of his sealed mouth.

The human stood up, anger clearly showing across his face.
"If you release just a hint of your poisoning gas, she-" he tilted his head towards someone Adrex couldn't see, "- will put an arrow through your skull before you have breathed your lounges out.
Do I make myself perfectly clear, dragonborn?"

He did, Adrex thought to himself.
This might have been the clearest message he'd ever received.
Did it really matter though?
The girl had tried to kill him for weeks, and now he was... caged in the iron bands, and her toying with him.
An arrow sounded like a quick death right now.
But it was interesting company he had found himself in, and right now he didn't know who of the three was the most dangerous to him.

The human snapped his finger, and the seal of Adrex' mouth and neck withdrew, allowing him to speak again.
Watering his mouth and teeth, he rephrased his reply:
"Yes, I am."

Adrex took a glance around to see another half-elf female with long black hair, and a spiked bow already loaded standing ready in the shadow, her face not giving away anything but a stern look.
Her clothing was nice and fitted though - almost royal.
But that confirmed it.

Adrex continued before the human could ask his second question:

"And you must be the parents of this..."
*Uh, choose these words carefully*
"girl, who have been trying to kill me over the past couple of weeks, I take?"

The human tilted his head, now more curious than angry, one eyebrow up, so Adrex went on:
"Based on the way you hold my gun, you know how to use it, which I believe only one individual knows how to." 
Adrex' eyes narrowed.
"- which makes you a member of Vox Machina, if *I* am not mistaken?"

His eyes had only one focus in the world, and that was trying to read this human.
He might hold enough power over his wife and child to keep Adrex alive a bit more.
They were the parents - hair gave it away, and not even Yurgunn had known how to hold the gun the first time, but this guy did.
Which meant that this was an ugly bet with destiny, since Adrex only ever heard one thing about the Vox Machina, and that was the story old Cleff Tinkertop had told a few months back.
But this time there had been no theft.

Adrex could see small grin on the human's face, before he pushed his circular spectacles up a nudge with two fingers, still holding Adrex' gun in his other hand.

"You are correct - on both accounts, mr. Scalenduur" he said, putting both hands behind his back, standing firm in front of his prisoner.
"For the record - my name is Lord Percival de Rolo the Third of Whitestone.
Do you know why we did so?"

There was a moment of silence, while the dragonborn's eyes searched his memories.
Adrex actually didn't know, even though he had questioned himself that many times over the past two weeks.
He had ideas, but they sounded ridiculous when he went over them.
He couldn't be for wealth - these guys looked like they had everything they needed, both in terms of equipment and magic - they could have everything they needed.
Did they hate highborns? 
Nah, he and his family had never done anything to any other dragonborns, and there would surely have been a ravenite gloating in here if that was the case.
It couldn't be to get secrets out of him of how a certain trap he had constructed could be bypassed - he wouldn't be alive to tell it.
So that left what he had done, and the biggest "crime" he could think of, was a deal he had made with the Krynn, and constructing the mobile trap, that had turned into...

Adrex' eyes went from confusion to almost disbelief, as he looked back to the lord in front of him.
"My guns?" he said, not really wanting to believe it.

The girl suddenly chimed in: 
"Dingeling - he got it!" she exclaimed with a heavy sarcasm.

*Why would they go after me?
I'm not part of anything they have done!*

"But I made them!" Adrex injected.
"I came up with them!"

"You came up with nothing, mr. Scalenduur", Percival countered.
"You might have made your own tweaks and modifications, but I most certainly guarantee you, you did not invent this monstrosity!"

He raised Adrex' gun which he held over its barrel and trigger - Adrex knew it was empty for bullet, and the Lord of Whitestone properly did too. <!-- A bit vague -->

"The only thing you came up with, was a way for the Krynn Dynasty to rage war upon the rest of its continent, if not the entire material plane!" <!-- Add emotion description -->
This most certainly had pulled a nerve with him.

"When these things came into existence, I struck a deal with a shadow demon, and the only thing these brought was pain and misery."
He knelt down right in front of Adrex' face, before he hissed at Adrex.
"Unless a certain Orthax is hiding within you, I'd guess you heard about these creations, and found a way to make them yourself for your own good."

This somehow struck closer to home than Adrex would have expected.
His gaze fell down at nothing in particular.
He had struck a deal, and the gun and the rifle was made for his own good, but only as a mean to escape.

Percival continued studying the dragonborn's face.
"It seems like I got close to the truth there, didn't I?
And when you finally made this, you went of to sell it to the highest bidder, hm?
Not considering the outcome of what would happen."

"I did" Adrex half replied, half countering.

"Just as I thought" replied the Lord of Whitestone, as he stood up from his crouched position.
He gesturing towards the half-elf in the shadow, that started pull her bowstring.

*What? 
I just said... oh for Bahamut's sake!*

"I *did* consider the consequences, and I had also struck a deal!"
It came out a bit harsh, but time was of the essence if he was not to end up dead.

Lord de Rolo stopped in his movement, as he held up a finger to pause the execution.
"Oh, it wasn't so much as *if* you considered it, but whether your intentions were good."
He slowly turned around.

"See, my daughter has a very special item with her, that allows her to quickly teleport back to its counterpart.
This item I keep with me at all times when she is on a mission."

He reached for a coat hanging over a chair he had been sitting on, and pull out a small piece of metal.

*Is that a used bullet?
Oh, not good*, Adrex thought to himself, as he swallowed.

"You see, when she uses this item, it takes a second before the effect kicks in, and when the only thing I see coming back is the remains of something that looks like my own bullets, I do not hesitate to take action.
For fragments like these..." he held it up for inspection, pausing a bit, before his eyes narrowed down in Adrex' and continued:
"-should not exist anywhere I am not".

He crouched down in front of Adrex again so their heads were leveled.
"My friends and I have means to get around in this world, and do so extremely fast. 
Locating my beloved daughter tasks no time, and finding a place to get to her takes only slightly longer."

Percival's voice became even colder and almost a whisper, as he continued:
"And when the first thing I see, emerging from the portal, is a dragonborn lying over my Vesper, claws out, ready to strike, praying to Tiamat, then it was only because I was dead set I could restrain you before you stroke, that I didn't shoot you dead on the spot."

He twisted his fingers slightly, and the ironbands slowly started to tighten harder, squeezing Adrex to a painful state, to which Adrex' starterd to groan in pain:
"I... I didn't... pray to... " 
He had to use all his will to say the last part, as the bands tightened around his chest, shoulders, arms, and legs. 
"... To Tiamat".

"You know" the human retorted.
"You are not the first dragonborn I've come across who had dealings with Tiamat.
When we defeated the demigod Vecna about 20 years ago, we had help from another dragonborn, who was pretty keen set on bringing Tiamat back to this plane.
I cannot help but wonder, if we just have a bad record with your kind, or there's something to it."

Still not easing the iron bands, Adrex felt no less pain, as he stumbled for words:
"I was... cursing... not pray- aaarhh... praying."
He had started gasping for air.

Adrex needed a way out of this, and he needed it fast.
If he spew his poison gas, the half-elf lady would shoot him with an arrow, and the Lord of Whitestone would properly do the same with a bullet, before crushing him with the iron bands.

What did he have to bargain with?
His life? it seemed worthless to them.
Something smooth to say? Even if he could think of something, he was in no state of actually say the words.
That left him with information they wanted.

"The designs..." he gasps, hoping this would at least spark an interest.

The girl, Vesper, injected faster than he got any further:
"Your scroll got stolen by a Krynn, so now we're in an even worse state."

It would take them too long to understand the content of it, cause he didn't want the notes to fall into their hands either.

"En... crypted..."

*Arrrhhh, this hurts everywhere!*

Suddenly the bands loosened ever so slightly, as the Lord of Whitestone grabbed his jaw, and turned it towards him.

"Encrypted what?" he asked sternly"

Heaving air into his lounges as fast as he could, Adrex tried to regain some focus.

"SPEAK" Percival demanded.

"The scroll..." Adrex started, taking another shaking breath "... was written with an encryption.
You can't read it, without the keystone."

Percival released his grip, and Adrex' previous state of panic slowly faded, as a more focus self took over his train of thoughts, before he continued:
"Or at least they won't for a while."

There was silence in the room, but for Adrex still taking some audible breaths, trying to calm himself down.

*It worked? 
They are not killing me?*

The Lord of Whitestone rose to his feet, pinching his eyebrows over the ridge of his nose.

The half-elf lady suddenly uttered her first word: 
"Darling?"

Her husband held up his other hands index finger, as a sign to pause the upcoming question, before he asked one himself:
"You say there is a keystone to figuring this out?"
