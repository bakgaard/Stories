# Prologue

*Year: 813 D.P.*

*Location: Draconia, floating south east of the Ashkeeper Peaks.*

The ground shook, causing everything in the house to tremble, clink, and fall over to the ground.
The eyes of the grown dragonborn whirled around to find a nearby cause, but settled on the front door, and the outside as the only source - nothing inside the house could cause everything to shake this much.
And most disturbingly was the feeling, that this must be what some would call an earthquake, which was absolutely impossible, since Draconia was a floating disc in the skies.
He dropped the planer he had been running over the wood, as another tremble made everything in the house vibrate, and he started running towards the front door - his mind still racing with what could cause this disturbing event. 

*Could it be the crystals that had stopped working?* he thought to himself, as the thought started to unravel what would happen if it was true.

The voice of his loving soulmate rang nervously from upstairs: "Dear - what was that?".

He really wanted to give her a clear answer, cause if his fear had come true, there would be some problems ahead for the city of the dragonborns.

"Mommy-" said the little voice of their 2-year old son. 
"I don't like it!"

The words carved into his father's heart, who wanted nothing more than reassure them both, that there was nothing to worry about.
He reached out for the handle, as a roar, louder than anything he had ever heard before, echoed through every inch of the house causing him stop dead in the motion.
He could feel his heart pounding, his breath inhale trembling, and his hand shaking as he laid it on the grip of the door.
He swallowed, and steeled himself for the encounter with the only kind of entity he could think capable of make such a noise, and still be so high up in the clouds.
The hardy door he had built himself made no audible noise as it swung up, but the surprisingly freezing cold wind hit his face as if a wall of snow had suddenly been dropped upon him.

The garden was not what he remembered from yesterday - where there had been green was now mostly white, and what had been waving in the wind was now stiff as icicles - literally.
As frozen in place, the long leaves and flowers now had a stiff angle to the same side, as some of them started to break under their own weight.
I took a second for the dragonborn to accept what he was seeing with his own two eyes - everything they had groomed in their little garden was dead with no hope of revival.

As his nostrils inhaled another lungful of air, a chill ran through his scaly body - both from the very sudden drop in temperature, but also from the realization of what destiny anyone who would have stayed next to the trees would have succumbed to.
His open mouth exhaled a clear fog in the weather from his warm breath.
This narrowed the range of entities down to precisely one. 
And as he turned his head around, stomps from the massive creature was heard clear as drums in 60 yards distance, as its huge form started moving into sight - the wings flapped twice as a storm started to form beneath its white, scaly torso, and as the two front legs landed, it roared again with a ferocity which hinted absolutely no mercy would come to anyone who would stand in its path.

He slammed the door shut, eyes wide open, and his mind tried to create an order of everything they now needed to do to survive.
He swirled towards the two creatures he held most dear in this world, as the dreadful words left his mouth:

"It's the white dragon - we have to leave."

It was said without any hints of hope. 
It was not a suggestion.
It was not up to debate.
Everything would be gone, and if they stayed too long, they would be as well.
The dread in the face of his soulmate showed no intentions of objecting.

"Get the egg, get a bag to it, take Ildrex under your arm, and get down here" he called upstairs, although they kept standing perfectly still.
As she stood at the top of the stairs, not moving a muscle, a sound of stone and wood being crushed echoed over the city.

"Now!" he shouted, as he himself started to move to his shop downstairs, where wooden chairs, -doors, -symbols, and -tools laid scrambled everywhere on the floor.
He forced his way through it all, towards the painting on the wall, which illustrated his father and mother holding hands, with his brother and himself on each of their laps.
He paused for a split second, as he realized this would be the last time he ever saw them, before he tore it to the ground, revealing a safe in the wall.
He spun the wheel back and forth as the combination clicked, unlocking the door to the one thing he had inherited from his parents most precious wrapped in a leather pouch.

A sound of arcane magic and a slight weight change on the wooden floors from the hallway suddenly announced a visitor he had not dared hope for.

"Donaar - is that you?" he yelled, as he eyed his chisel on the bench.

"Ay, brother - it is I" a slightly older voice rang back. 
"Do you have the stone?"
The tone of the question was clear, demanding, but most of all worried.

"Right here" came the reply from the small shop.
He grabbed his tool bag, dropped the leather pouch down into it, swung it over his shoulder, and rushes out to the entrance.

There, in a blue and black robe, stood his green scaled, elder brother with the arcane magic still fading around him, and his staff clutched in both hands, looking more tired than he usually did, panting, and with fear in his eyes.

"It came, Nadraa" he started, still gasping for air. 
"And it came way faster than Kruvanis and the High Council had anticipated. 
There is nothing we can do now."

Another building close by came tumbling down, and the rumble hit the walls of the house, sending shock waves through the floor.

Nadraa quickly swept in to catch his brother before he fell on his knees. 
They all knew that the Chroma Conclave had attacked and burned Emon to the ground only a few days before, and the other great cities of Tal'Dorei would be next.
So the High Council had prepared their army, and gone through procedures for defenses, but to no avail.

Nadraa and his brother, however, had made emergency plans, should the worst happen - and it had.

"Sora!?" Nadraa called to his soulmate.
"Are yo-" but he halted the rest of his line, as she came rushing down the stairs with Ildrex in her arms, and a bag over her shoulder.

"It's not good for the egg to be carried like this" she began worried, before yet another building nearby collapsed, sending large chunks of walls flying at their own.
They all hugged each other in a small circle, as the dust started to fall from the roof.

"Donaar, dear - get us out of here!" she pleaded.

The eyes of robed dragonborn lit up in white arcane magic, as the wall of the house suddenly fell in over the hallway. 
But as the stones hit the floor, they crushed only the carpet, and the arcane residue that were left behind.
