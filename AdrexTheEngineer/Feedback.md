# PROLOGUE

* I enjoyed the introduction of the cast and the setting - you give adequate context of what constitutes Draconia, but you leave room for the audience to imagine what else is there in the settlement above the clouds.

* I spotted numerous typos and a tendency to use the [15 Words](https://www.themuse.com/advice/15-words-you-need-to-eliminate-from-your-vocabulary-to-sound-smarter) but they don't stop the experience as a whole from delivering the message across.

* You go for an exciting incident right from the get-go (the White Dragon's arrival) and work the emotional angle to involve the reader into your setting.

* Your background as an engineer is reflected in the narrative style (orderly, detailed) and the description of the garden shows it - Introduction, Development, Conclusion.

* You tend to add exposition and details in some passages which seem to break immersion from the present tension (Adrex's family fleeing from the dragon seems more important than explaining the existence of cities outside their own for the moment.)


# FIRST

* Good use of details in the line of work which Adrex and Yurgunn pursue to involve tech-savvy readers into their world-perspective; drops the knowledge Adrex is an engineer and thus has qualities of one later on which make up his personality.

* Inclusion of accents for unique vocal-prints makes it easier to distinguish who's talking, plus adds a layer of characterization to them for uniqueness.

* Inclusion of Adrex's personal 'height gripe' adds another detail to him, indicating he wants something he can't have because of his personal circumstances.

* A tendency to 'TELL-OVER-SHOW' permeates the narrative.


# SECOND

* There's high-detail exposition in this chapter, which was saved by a spotlight of Adrex amongst his family members, so it has another emotional component, even if the length seems daunting.

* Perhaps it was me reading between the lines, but I sensed you were projecting yourself into the family dinner situation and how Adrex and Ilbrex experienced a falling out; this kind of angle is good when you want to make the narrative feel authentic and engaging.


# THIRD

* I found this chapter heavy-handed to my personal taste because of the back-and-forth exchange of ideas between engineers, but the enthusiasm shared by the three also indicates they're co-workers and trust each other on matters of import.

* I enjoyed Victoria's input on wanting to convince Adrex to have a proper 'give-and-take' of ideas; gave me the sense either he likes her, or he's a hormonal youth at the time. (Personal input of mine - Rocket-based innuendos, if treated under another light, can hint at symbolist desires.)


# FOURTH

* Good further character spotlight on Adrex and how he processes stress under pressure, hints he's still young and inexperienced and unwise to the greater world and political dealings out there.

* The inclusion of the Vox seems like an unnecessary detail at this point (how the story has been framed thus far) but it doesn't necessarily mean the threat Adrex is building is not linked to it; they could be introduced further down the road.


# FIFTH

* The combination between serious comedy and the experimental procedure gave the sense the narrative was moving along and my interest was retained more than in the previous installments.

* Another mention of Adrex and his 'racial pride' issues seems like a recurring theme which the story can tentatively rest on for a stronger message.


# OVERALL IMPRESSION

* The story has room to grow, but I believe it would benefit from some tailoring and edits to balance the level of exposition and action.
* This current write-up was difficult for me to enjoy because it leaned towards engineering jargon and I have a difficult time becoming interested over machines and mathematics and 'hard science'.
