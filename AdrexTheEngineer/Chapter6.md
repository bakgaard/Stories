Measuring how long it takes for an object to fall a certain height isn't hard at all, Adrex found out.
Wrap a sandbag in on end of a rope, measure a distance you want it to fall, and drop it from a cliff.
When the robe pulls, it is at its end, and you measure the time it tool.

Obvious to both Adrex and Yurgunn was, that the longer the sandbag fell, the less was the time difference compared to the last notation. 
It kept speeding up.
It wasn't unexpected though if you flipped the viewpoint - the more black powder would send a ball higher up, but eventually it would stop flying upwards as it would come to a halt, and it fell down again.

As Adrex sat at his desk, he had plotted all the measurements into a coordinate system, which he was now looking it. pondering how to get a formula out of it.
