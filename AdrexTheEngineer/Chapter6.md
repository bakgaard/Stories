Measuring how long it takes for an object to fall a certain distance isn't hard at all, Adrex found out.
Wrap a sandbag in one end of a rope, measure a distance you want it to fall on the rope, and drop it from a cliff.
When the robe pulls, it is at its end, and you measure the time it took.

Obvious to both Adrex and Yurgunn was, that the longer the sandbag fell, the less was the time difference compared to the last notation - it kept speeding up.

As Adrex sat at his desk, he had plotted all the measurements into a coordinate system, which he was now looking it, pondering how to get a formula out of it.

The more black powder they used, the higher they would send a ball up, but eventually it would stop flying upwards as it would come to a halt, and it fell down again.
He hoped it would align with his theory; the travel time upwards, is the same downwards.

He took his pen, and drew a line through each line, which bend slightly to
