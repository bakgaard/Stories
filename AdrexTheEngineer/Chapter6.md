Measuring how long it takes for an object to fall a certain distance isn't hard at all, Adrex found out.
Wrap a sandbag in one end of a rope, measure a distance you want it to fall on the rope, and drop it from a cliff.
When the robe pulls, it is at its end, and you measure the time it took.

Obvious to both Adrex and Yurgunn was, that the longer the sandbag fell, the less was the time difference compared to the last notation - it kept speeding up.

As Adrex sat at his desk, he had plotted all the measurements into a coordinate system, which he was now looking it, pondering how to get a formula out of it.

The more black powder they used, the higher they would send a ball up, but eventually it would stop flying upwards as it would come to a halt, and it fell down again.
He hoped it would align with his theory; the travel time upwards, is the same downwards.

The base line showed how many feet they had dropped the sandbag, and vertical line showed how long it had taken in seconds.
Adrex sighed heavily as he dropped the pen on the notes.

"Yurgunn - can we get a more precise measuring glass?" he called to his master, though he already knew that would not happen.

The response from the front of the shop was monotone, and without comfort:
"When yeh' find someone who can make very slim hourglass, sure.
But until then, yeh' have t' make due."

The data was not what Adrex hoped for.
They had measure for 50 feet at a time, and in the beginning it had been as expected:
2 seconds, 2.5 seconds, 3 seconds, 3.5 seconds... It took longer to fall longer.

But between 300 to 350 feet they had had a hard time measuring difference - both seemed about 4.5 seconds.
Then 5 seconds for 400 feet, and then 5.5 for both 450 and 500 feet.
And from there on every time measurement had become duplicates for every 50 feet, except for 850 feet to 950 feet, which they had measured to 7.5 seconds for all three of them.

A line through each point made it bend slightly towards a flat line, like flowers in a strong breeze. 
The truth properly hid somewhere between, but they couldn't measure it.
Well, if the line he had drawn through them would be the new truth, he better find a formula from it.

Tapping the pen to the his green scales at his jaw, Adrex looked at the new line.
It looked a bit like something he had drawn before, but he wasn't quite sure.
He picked up a book from under a pile of notes, and flipped through it.
It contained all sorts of formulas he and Yurgunn had come across, and written down for reference later on.
He stopped at a page, where the line looked a lot like the one he had in his notebook, showing a table of numbers with the simple formula of a square root for a number, and a small drawing of how the numbers could visually be represented.

Comparing the two for a short moment gave Adrex the conclusion, that this was pretty much the same, which meant he could do the inverse to get a straight line.
And straight lines were easy to calculate.

Using the table, he noted a new set of values, which was the result without the square root.
Plotting them for visual representation, he now had a smooth straight line.
A grin of achievement crawled up on Adrex' right side, this was almost too easy, when he just did it, instead of complaining about it.

"1000 feet is 64, which means each feet is 0.064" he mumbled to himself, as he noted it down to the side of the data points.
"Then every 50 feet will be... lets see... multiply by 100, and divide by two, that is... 0.64, which is 0.32... which multiplied by something gives 50 feet."

Adrex closed his eyes, as the numbers started to fly by in his brain.
After a short moment, he wrote '16' on the paper, and added it to his formula.
Time to hit the ground in seconds: feet times 16, and square root it all.
It wasn't exact, but close enough.

He made a few calculations which he plotted into the original data just to be sure, which to his relief seemed to fit pretty well.
Now he just needed to compare the new formula to the data from the tube experiment, and they were done.
The twins just had to say how long they wanted the firework go in feet to calculate the time of the fuse burn time.

He took it all in for a moment, as he straightened his back.
What else did he need?
He had a formula, based on what they had given him, so he was actually done.
With renewed energy, he jumped to his feet, and strode into the front of the shop shining as a second sun in the day.

Yurgunn sat with the financial records plotting expenses, and didn't even look up when he partner came through the door. 
She did though inquire:
"So, have yeh' come for help, lad?"

Adrex sat the notebook down before her open to the page with the formula, and its visual representation.

"Nope" he said proudly, as he presented his findings.
"I got a famula and everything - check it out."

Yurgunn shot up an eyebrow as she reach for the book, keeping her reading glasses on, as she started to inspect the notes.
She took a short moment looking it over.

"That looks good, Adri' - well done." she said impressed by what she had written.
"How much did the ball weigh?"

*The ball?* Adrex thought to himself. 
*Why does that have any rele...* before it clicked for him.

"OH, POOP!" he shouted, as his palms slammed into his temporals.

Oh, how could he have forgotten the parameters.
Of cause they wouldn't be shooting balls with the same weight as the one he had been using into the air.
They might even have different size tubes which of cause would affect the outcome of the height and time.

Yurgunn however was still smiling, though a bit smug:
"So, yeh' *did* come for help?"

Did she know?
Had she just been waiting for him to come and fail in front of her?
No, that wasn't her style.
She had never tried to humiliate him, so what was this?

"Adri', you know dragonborns don't really have a lot of facial tells, but you can be read like an open book" she continued, as she jumped off her chair, and started walking into the workshop.

"And it just came to me, if it could sent an anvil in the air with the same amount of powder, and that the weight must have some sort of impact on this formula.
Again - good job with this", she said with her back to him, as she waved the book a bit back and forth.
"It is properly just a factor which needs to be applied inside the square root."

Her former apprentice stood baffled, as she had managed to tear down his newfound energy, apologies for it, and build it up again in a few sentences.

As he dragged his fingers over his face, he let out another sigh.

"Yeah, or outside the square root. 
I think it just affects the initial speed, more than it determines the physics of how it flies."

Yurgunn turned her head as she walk, looking slightly confused.
"Wha' do yeh' mean?"

As Adrex followed, he started to explain.
"I'm not sure it matters so much what the ball weighs, to the factor inside the square root.
If we drop the ball, or we drop an anvil, they would have been standing still to begin with. 
And as soon as we release them, they will start to drop.
I will gladly make another experiment just with that, but the weight might just affect how fast the ball comes to a halt when being sent upwards, and I think it's the same for the tube's diameter."

As Yurgunn reached the metal ball in the workshop they had been using, she took it in her hand and tossed it up a few times, before she turned around to face Adrex again.

"We need somethin' lighter and somethin' heavier, but with the same size."

She lobbed the ball to him, as she took the tube from the table to inspect it, as she continued:
"And we need somethin' wider and somethin' narrower in diameter. 
And these must have their own set of different size balls with different weighs t' test with."

She started to look around the workshop.
"Yeh' got any suggestions?"

Adrex stood nodding through all of it, and as the ball came flying, he grabbed it with ease, and started tossing it in the air as he had done with the apple.
He caught the ball, held it between two fingers, as his mind started to solve the new problem ahead.

"This is made of iron, right?"

A short nod came back from the former master smith.

"What if we made some balls out of something lighter and heavier?
I could be steel and... lead, perhaps?" he said, before he lobbed the ball back to the dwarf.

As she caught it, she had a wry face.
"Nah, both suggestions are no good here.
Steel weighs the same as iron, but it's way harder when treated correctly. 
Tha's why yeh' less of it, and armors and weapons weigh way less."

She started walking towards the forge.
"Lead has the unfortunate property, that it will start to misform on hard impacts, and A' doubt yeh' will catch it when it comes down?"

She lobbed the ball back to Adrex, before she started going over their stock.

"Well, perhaps copper, if that's lighter?" the dragonborn suggested.

"Ay, copper could be good, but it's actually heavier than iron" she said, as she fished a plate out from a rack.

"What about we use wood as the last... no, forget it" Adrex interrupted himself.
That sounded even more silly when he said it.
The twins wasn't going to send up wood - it was metals all the way.

"Ehm... silver?" he tried.

Yurgunn stopped in her track, lookup, looked to Adrex with an expression saying 'stupid', although it seemed to change a bit, as her eyes started to look up - she was considering it.

Adrex tried to push the idea a bit further.
"I mean, we paid the guards 20 gold pieces, and for just 10 gold pieces we could get enough silver to three balls?"

"Silver is heavy" Yurgunn finally said after a small pause.
"Take 10 gold pieces from the safe, and head to the Armavault.
And be a bit hasty about it - no detours."

Adrex placed the iron ball on the workbench, before he went downstairs to their... well, they like to call it the "War Room".
They didn't plan wars, or make plans for armies to march, but they had test setups of their trap mechanisms to show to clients, and to try out while making something new for clients.
Currently they didn't have any active clients who needed the War Room, but that didn't mean the room was without traps.
They still had setups they like to experiment with.

And to the side of all of this hang a frame with a drawing of Yurgunn's former colleagues.
Her master, Dulgrim Smeltborn, and her fellow apprentice Umagorn Smeltborne - the son of Dulgrim.
They hang as a reminder to do what you do properly, even though Yurgunn rarely talked about the time she was with them.

Adrex took a step towards it on a large pressure plate, waited for 20 seconds, and then reached out to swing open the frame, which was attached with two hinges on the left side.
Behind the frame, inside the wall, a safe's facade with green painting on sat, guarded by a few safety mechanism which Adrex already carefully came around, leaving the last one to guard it.
On the safe were a grid of four by four metal buttons, which could be pressed.
When done so in the correct order, a small wheel could be turned, and the safe opened.

Entering the code, Adrex spun the wheel, and opened the door into a 20 by 20 by 20 inch room, filled with coins, gems, and other valuable items they had accepted as payment over the years.

Grabbing 10 gold pieces, he closed the vault again, spun the wheel, and left upstairs again with a small coin sack.
Before he left, Yurgunn called out.

"Just t' be sure, Adri' - don't mention we are 'bout to reforge the coins.
Tha's not legal, so come up with something else if they ask, aight'?"

*Something to remember, for sure*, Adrex thought to himself, as he left to the northern side of the mountainside of Hupperdook. 
The weather seemed didn't change much this time of year, even though Wild's Grandeur was just around the corner, so spring ought to be well under way, but Hupperdook never had much wild growth.
The barren fields all covered in sod had some moss here and there, and the only real flowers to be found would be picked by what wildlife was located around the city when it flourished.
Plants with thorns could still be found though.
Not that they bothered Adrex, but they were annoying for most other people in Hupperdook since they had soft skin.

Making his way to the Armavault on the sod covered road,
