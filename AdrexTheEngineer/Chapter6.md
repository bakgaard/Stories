Measuring how long it takes for an object to fall a certain distance isn't hard at all, Adrex found out.
Wrap a sandbag in one end of a rope, measure a distance you want it to fall on the rope, and drop it from a cliff.
When the robe pulls, it is at its end, and you measure the time it took.

Obvious to both Adrex and Yurgunn was, that the longer the sandbag fell, the less was the time difference compared to the last notation - it kept speeding up.

As Adrex sat at his desk, he had plotted all the measurements into a coordinate system, which he was now looking it, pondering how to get a formula out of it.

The more black powder they used, the higher they would send a ball up, but eventually it would stop flying upwards as it would come to a halt, and it fell down again.
He hoped it would align with his theory; the travel time upwards, is the same downwards.

The base line showed how many feet they had dropped the sandbag, and vertical line showed how long it had taken in seconds.
Adrex sighed heavily as he dropped the pen on the notes.

"Yurgunn - can we get a more precise measuring glass?" he called to his master, though he already knew that would not happen.

The response from the front of the shop was monotone, and without comfort:
"When yeh' find someone who can make very slim hourglass, sure.
But until then, yeh' have t' make due."

The data was not what Adrex hoped for.
They had measure for 50 feet at a time, and in the beginning it had been as expected:
2 seconds, 2.5 seconds, 3 seconds, 3.5 seconds... It took longer to fall longer.

But between 300 to 350 feet they had had a hard time measuring difference - both seemed about 4.5 seconds.
Then 5 seconds for 400 feet, and then 5.5 for both 450 and 500 feet.
And from there on every time measurement had become duplicates for every 50 feet, except for 850 feet to 950 feet, which they had measured to 7.5 seconds for all three of them.

A line through each point made it bend slightly towards a flat line, like flowers in a strong breeze. 
The truth properly hid somewhere between, but they couldn't measure it.
Well, if the line he had drawn through them would be the new truth, he better find a formula from it.

Tapping the pen to the his green scales at his jaw, Adrex looked at the new line.
It looked a bit like something he had drawn before, but he wasn't quite sure.
He picked up a book from under a pile of notes, and flipped through it.
It contained all sorts of formulas he and Yurgunn had come across, and written down for reference later on.
He stopped at a page, where the line looked a lot like the one he had in his notebook, showing a table of numbers with the simple formula of a square root for a number, and a small drawing of how the numbers could visually be represented.

Comparing the two for a short moment gave Adrex the conclusion, that this was pretty much the same, which meant he could do the inverse to get a straight line.
And straight lines were easy to calculate.

Using the table, he noted a new set of values, which was the result without the square root.
Plotting them for visual representation, he now had a smooth straight line.
A grin of achievement crawled up on Adrex' right side, this was almost too easy, when he just did it, instead of complaining about it.

"1000 feet is 64, which means each feet is 0.064" he mumbled to himself, as he noted it down to the side of the data points.
"Then every 50 feet will be... lets see... multiply by 100, and divide by two, that is... 0.64, which is 0.32... which multiplied by something gives 50 feet."

Adrex closed his eyes, as the numbers started to fly by in his brain.
After a short moment, he wrote '16' on the paper, and added it to his formula.
Time to hit the ground in seconds: feet times 16, and square root it all.
It wasn't exact, but close enough.

He made a few calculations which he plotted into the original data just to be sure, which to his relief seemed to fit pretty well.
Now he just needed to compare the new formula to the data from the tube experiment, and they were done.
The twins just had to say how long they wanted the firework go in feet to calculate the time of the fuse burn time.
