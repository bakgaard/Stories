# Chapter 3

"Bye mom, bye dad, bye Uncle Donaar!" Adrex shouted over his shoulder, as he rushed through the door with his satchel over his shoulder.
Today was a new day - with new opportunities to explore, investigate, and engineer.
He had a plan for the day, and he was excited to get to working.

As he walked with a hasty speed towards the city, he had started humming [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hHfDTVgs0Q) he had heard one time in a tavern, performed by a traveling group:

"*Hupperdoo-oo-ook, Hupperdoo-oo-ook*

*We set the course for Hupperdook.*

*Hupperdoo-oo-ook, Hupperdoo-oo-ook*

*The wind leads us to Hupperdook*"

They had been playing on violin, lutes, accordion, flute, and an odd box which had set the beat. 
And they had all been singing as the song went on. 
The mood was at its peak that night in the tavern, no doubt about it.

Almost dancing his way through the door under the sign that said "Hammer and Scale", his dwarven colleague raised both an eyebrow and a smile seeing him.

"Well, well - someone's in e' good mood, eh?" she greeted him.

"... to Hup-per-dook" Adrex finished, as the music in his head finished.
"Indeed, a good day" he continued.
"And good morning to you, Yurgunn."

"Care te' share wha' got yeh' so high up t'day?"
She had a smile on her face, seeing Adrex so happy and lively. 
Normally he sat with his face buried in notes, writing, calculating, and mumbling to himself.

"Absolutely" Adrex replied, fumbling in his satchel, before he made a pause, looking a bit around for nothing but his own thoughts.

"Point of order: gears, then rockets", as he took off his back, and went to the workshop in the back.
"Come - you have to see them in action".

As he walked past Yurgunn, she lit up even more:
"Uh, yeh' got 'em working?" she exclaimed.

Adrex turned his head with a grin on his face. 
"Oh, did I".

As he took the last few steps towards the bench with his setup, he stood a bit to the side, so Yurgunn could see what he had made. 
He let the lead piece hang freely in the air, which made everything spin a few degrees, as it got loaded.

"So - as you can see - the plate is pushed up by this spring.
The spring, when pushed down, will let go of this lever, which releases the break of these gears.
They are set in motion because of this piece of lead dragging them down, and because of the size of the gears, it will only drop a few inches, but spin the gear over here..." Adrex had to check at his notes, just to be sure.
"... 8 times, before the gears lock again by the lever and the spring".

He stood for a moment looking at it all, nodding to himself, before Yurgunn interrupted his inner fanfare.

"Yeh' tell'n me, tha' tha' plate being pushed down, will only make this stone drop a nudge, but spin tha' gear 8 times, before it's ready again?"
Her tone was a combination of disbelief and amazement, so Adrex just took a step back, and opened his hand towards the plate as a gesture for her to try it.

She had one of her expressions on her face where he could almost hear her say "really now?", and as she walked around the table, she held her hand above the plate with a stretch finger, still looking at Adrex.

Adrex nodded twice, as she pressed it down with narrow eyes.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click* - in that order, as the gear spun from the drag of the lead piece, letting it fall just a few inches, as the plate raised itself again, and the lever snapped into place, keeping the gears in check.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*.

Yurgunn's finger kept pressing the plate, with a visibly excited facial expression.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Eh's like a toy, Adri!
A' could keep press'en this buttom all day."
She was like hypnotized of it.

Adrex folded his arms, rather proud of what he had made.

"I didn't get to try it much yesterday, but the math is solid" he said with a smile on his face.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"So, wha' would yeh' say this could be used for?" Yurgunn asked, as she sat down in a chair next to the table, looking him in the eyes.

"Well, there's the obvious trap, that keeps reloading" Adrex started.
"Then there's-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"-the..." Adrex had a hard time not giggling, as Yurgunn pressed the plate again.
"eh - the gears can spin an exact amount of time, which-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

The dwarf didn't take her eyes from his, and her face were without a change, as she clicked the plate again.

"... could - hehe - make two devices work in-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Yurgunn, pl... please stop." 
A combination of laughter and frustration was building up inside Adrex, as the dwarf kept her eyes on him, as she pressed the plated another time.

"I'm list'ning, Adri" she said without a change in her face.

"... In synchroniz-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Yurgunn-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Please, I-"

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

Adrex couldn't contain his laughter any longer.
It was funny, but it was also annoying beyond anything he had tried for a long time, and for each press, a shiver shot through his bones, making him weak in his knees, and left an itch he had to rub away.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Hihi - stop it, Yurgunn - hihi. 
I- I can't..." Adrex actually couldn't stand up anymore, and his knees gave in under him, as he fell to the ground giggling like a little kid.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

"Wha's tha', Adri?" the dwarf said with tone of wonder, but a mind only out to tease him.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

It was like a dozen of small insects crawling around inside his bones, making every joint in this body itch and nothing to help it.
And it kept getting worse and worse for each click.

*Click, zzzzuuuuuiiii, duk, click*

*Click, zzzz, du-duk*

The lead piece hit the ground.
Adrex' knees were still itching along with his elbows, hand wrists, ankles, and shoulders, and he was still giggling, though less audible and more focused on rubbing his joints.

"Looks more la' yeh' mad' a toy, Adri" the dwarf said with a big grin on her face, as she turned back to the setup to study it further.

"Of cause we can use it fo' traps - tha's obvious" she said, with her face up close to one of the gears. 
"Yeh started te' say somethin' 'bout e' makin' a certain amount of spin, and somethin' about two devices, eh?"

Adrex had finally gather himself enough to get an arm up at the table to help him up from the floor.

"Yeah, the gears turn in perfect unison - they cannot not be exactly where you expect them to be with the math.
They don't skip a cog - even though they are so small."
He was still rubbing his wrists as he got up.

Yurgunn had raised an eyebrow at this moment, as if an idea had struck her.

"Wha' 'bout tha' Tinkertop fam'ly?
They might be in need of som'n like this?" 
She looked back to Adrex, who had tilted his head a bit to the side.
"We could get 'em over to see the pos'bilities, and sell 'em the schematics, ai?"

Adrex liked the sound of that. 
If Cleff Tinkertop and his daugther, Rissannya, would buy it, then they could sell it to others as well.

"Yeah", Adrex said, nodding while scratching the back of his head.
"That sounds like a plan.
Do you want to setup the meeting today?"

Yurgunn clapped the table, as she started walking towards the door.
"No time t' waste!
We've money t' make."

She suddenly made a halt, before entering the front of the store, as she turned a worried face towards Adrex.
"Yeh' said som'n 'bout rockets before?"

"Yeah, I have been thinking about the mobile trap from yesterday, and I think I came up with a..." 
He had to find a phrase for it.
"... possible path to investigate.
Rockets are the stepping stone."

Yurgunn didn't seem less worried by that statement, but started nodding.
"Yeh' wan' t' send som'n like rockets towards the target?" 

She wasn't convinced at all by the look on her face.
"Ay - tha' most indeed be a stepping stone.
I need t' hear more about it later.
First, I'll head over t' Tinkertop n' ask if 'e wan' t' com'n have a look a' this", she said nodding her head towards the bench and its setup, "and then we'll talk more 'bout rockets, ai'?"

She was already about to leave through the front door, as Adrex called out to her: 
"You won't mind, if I stop by the twins for some research, right?"
That usually wasn't a problem.

"Just don't tell 'em the secrets this time!" came a stern reply.

It *usually* wasn't a problem - for a reason.
When Adrex had an idea and people probed him about it, he had a hard time holding back about the details. 
And that was half of their business - selling functional ideas, and turning these ideas into actual solutions for clients.

Well - that meant he had an hour or two, before a demonstration was needed from him.
He grabbed his satchel, checked his notebook and pencil was in there, and found the sign for the front door.
Well, it wasn't a sign, but more a modular board, with the carved in text:

**Not in the store.**

**Will be back at __ __ __ __.**

The blank line at the end was a hole, which showed a small part of a spinner.
The spinner had the text "noon", "evening", and "tomorrow" engraved.
This way they could reuse the same sign whenever they went out, but modify it to show clients who came by about when to expect them back.

Adrex turned it to *noon*, placed it on the door, locked it, and headed towards the twins and their shop.
He had tried to figure out how to conceal how he could ask questions, that wouldn't give away what he was making - or planning to make at least.
He had made a small list of phrases he thought would not give away too much, yet stay close enough to the subject.
Basically, he needed to know why rockets took so long to fly off, what made them fly, and if they could fly straight in any way.
That could be wrapped into some questions that wouldn't spark too much of an interest with the twins.

After a few minutes of walking, Adrex turned a corner, and could see the two stories tall building which had its own flat roof which acted as a launchpad.
The sign at the door said **Rockets with sparkles and glitter**, and it fooled no one.
The twins specialized in sparkles and glitter, because that was what their customers wanted to see, and the customers would even have a chance to see some being shot off from the roof.

Adrex stood outside the door for a short moment, gathering his thoughts, and wiggled his face to look relaxed, clearing his voice with a few coughs, before he knocked trice on the door, and entered.

The first thing Adrex noted when he entered was, that the air in here was not as bad as it had been at earlier occasions.
It still had a bit of powder hanging in here, but this train of thought was shoved away as he saw one of the twins, Victoria, sitting with on the floor, knees up, and face buried in her hands - clearly not happy about something, though not audible crying.
As the door bell rang, a small shock went through her, as a face with red swollen eyes look towards the him, quickly changing a depressed frown to... a delight?

Adrex wasn't sure what to say, but tried anyway: "Eh... Victo-"

He was cut off, as she leapt up from the floor, and almost shot herself into him, arms hugging him.

"Oh, Adrex - just the one I needed to see" she started, her voice cracking a bit.
"I don't know if I can keep on doing this." 

Adrex had to scan the room for whatever could have caused this, as he gently put his arms around her, lightly patting her on the back.
There was no sign of a break-in, the desk had its papers stacked neatly, and finished products were stacked in glass cases - ah, there - at the floor, next to where she had been sitting was a scroll on the floor.
That must have been what caused this.

"There, there" he said, still with some confusion in his voice.
"How can I help you?"

She released him of her hug, as she took a step back, and wiped her right eye with her sleeve.

"You are one of the most sensible individuals I know, and I..." she started, before she cut herself off with as her arms made a resigning gesture, as her voice went from a helpless state to irritated.
"I need common sense around, and perhaps a bit more than that."


Adrex stilled had too little to go on, so he just took the compliment, as he closed the door behind him.

"Okay... Ehm, tell me what happened", Adrex said, as Victoria had started to rub her temples.

She let go of her head, and held her hands in the air for a second, before she spun around towards the scroll on the ground.
A firmness entered her voice along with frustrations.

"We received a complaint!
The customer was *not* happy, and have said they will never buy anything from us again".
She had picked up the scroll, and started waving it in the air, before she slammed it down on the table.

That was indeed bad news, Adrex thought to himself.
If the customer had even taken the time to write the twins, it must have been a really bad experience they had had.

"Okay - did the rocket misfire, or something like that?" Adrex asked, still not quite sure why he was the one she wanted to see over a complaint she had gotten.
Adrex wasn't too good around customers, so he didn't have a whole lot of good advice to give on that subject.

"What? No - never!
Our rockets always works." Victoria replied, with a rushed voice, and continued with a more frustrated tone:
"The dimwit who wrote this thought they would be helpful, and wrote down the entire event!" 

*Well, that makes it easier to find the root cause.*
Adrex didn't say it, but just hang his satchel at the coat stand, as Victoria started to read from the paper.

"*To 'Rockets with sparkles and glitter'.*"

"*After my purchase at your shop, and many promises of the best money could buy, I am deeply disappointed in the result. 
You even included a ridiculously long guide of how to proceed, and after reviewing it several times, I found I did everything to the point, but still ended up disappointed with the result.*"

She had picked it up and started pacing back and forth in the room, as she read it aloud.

"*I placed it in a tube, as specified in section 5, cleared the area around it as specified in section 3, had the necessary protection gear* - yada, yada, yada." 
She skipped most of the steps, as she continued:

"*- and we almost couldn't see it.*
*The sky was clear of clouds, and the rocket went straight up, and my would-be-business partner and I agreed, that this was the most disappointing ending to an otherwise wonderful* ***lunch arrangement!***".

As she looked up from the paper with look of disbelief, it hit Adrex what was wrong, but he didn't get to more than open his mouth, before she slammed the scroll onto the counter, and with a fury Adrex never had imagined Victoria had inside her, roared: "THAT IDIOT FIRED IT MIDDAY!"

She took a step towards the chair, as she collapsed in it, heavy breathing, as she tried to calm herself.

Adrex had a challenge with what to do with himself.
This was one of the most stupid things he had ever heard a customer do, and it so clearly justified why Victoria had to write all of these manuals. 
But he couldn't laugh of it, cause the situation did not call out for laughter.

He understood her frustration though, cause they had had stupid clients as well, who 'wanted to try their own security system, and had been hurt' - which was the point with said security system.
When they had gotten that news, Adrex had not been able to contain himself, and there was still a clear mark in his workbench from his hammer, where he had slammed it several times until the initial rage had left his body - now serving him as a reminder, that clients must have very clear instructions of what they can do - and what they cannot do - with their products.


Careful with his words, Adrex thought he might be able to shift Victoria's thoughts to something else.
"So, what does Smearchuckle think of the situation?"

A smile could be seen shortly at Victoria's face, as she kept staring into her desk.
"She is always thinking about the business, you know.
'Can't have people talking bad about the shop'.
So she have decided to make an 'apology'-gift for the client..."

*Well, that's nice of her...*

"... with extra powder in it, very short fuse, and no instructions."

Adrex couldn't hide his silent laughter that caused his chest to spasm.
Victoria's fury had left, and was replaced with a smirk, as she turned her head towards the backroom Smearchuckle usually would be in.

"I better go see she won't be blowing up this place" Victoria said, as she stood up.

*Uh, this might be my chance*, Adrex thought to himself, as he probed with a combination of worry and curiosity: 
"Blow up, you say?"

Victoria was on her way to the back, as she simply replied: 
"Well, that's what happens if you stuff the powder too tightly. 
Then the rockets won't fly up, but simply blow."

*Not too tight - got it*.

As she reached the door, she knocked on it twice as she yelled: 
"Hey - Chuckly'. 
Is it safe to enter?"

The answer that came back was from a more deep and harsh voice, which had a keen intelligence behind it:
"Just don't smack any of the equipment around, and you'll be fine!"

Victoria rolled her eyes as she entered the door:
"That was *one* time, Chuckly'.
Can you please leave it in the past where it belongs?"

Adrex followed suit, as Smearchuckle's comeback cut clear through their shop:
"LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES!"

Adrex had, over time, found out this was the family motto, and could only wonder how it had come to be, but had not dared asking.

He poked his head inside, as the smell of sulfur and charcoal hit his nostrils.
"Hey Smearchuckle - I hear things are bad today?"

The room reminded him somehow of his own workshop's backroom, except Adrex had files, hammers, and anvils, while Smearchuckle had labeled bottles with powder, mortars, weights, and parchments lying around.

Victoria's sister sat with a mortar and a pestle, grinding something to powder, as she looked towards Adrex and Victoria. 
She had a serious expression which shifted more towards a smile, as his face peaking through the door.

"Well, if it isn't our favorite tinker". 
She sat up a bit, as she brushed her hair with one end of the pestle.
"Yes, the customer couldn't see enough fireworks, so I'm trying to give him a really good blast. 
But I'm facing a bit of an issue with the weight-to-nozzle-width ratio, so the rocket won't take off at this state."

Adrex looked slightly confused.
To his knowledge, a rocket flew because the powder inside burned through a small hole - called a nozzle, pushing the rocket upwards.
The more powder, the bigger the nozzle.
The bigger the nozzle, the more could be pushed forward.

"Don't you have a fixed ratio for that? 
Like 2/3 of compound A, and 1/3 compound B, or something like that?"

It was a honest question, and perhaps he could learn something from Smearchuckle.
She was the one who came up with the materials and formulas, and Victoria came with the ideas, and helped assemble the rockets with Smearchuckle's instructions.

The expression he got back from her, however, clearly stated he had that wrong.
He glanced towards Victoria, who had a curious look on her face, as if that was her understanding as well.

"Is that...?" he started.

"No" Smearchuckle replied a bit tired.
"No, not quite."

She had put down the mortar and the pestle, as she tapped a finger on the edge of the mortar, clearly pondering something.
She then held up a finger, stood up from her chair, and walked over to a table behind her.

"Let's make a small quiz, shall we?" she said, as she grabbed a bottle with powder, and a metal plate.
She made to rows of powder on the plate - both the same length, but one row had more powder in it that the other.

"The question is simple - which row will burn faster? 
The thin, or the tick?" she said as she pointed towards the two rows.

That seemed simple enough - the more powder, the more could burn, and the faster it would burn. 

Adrex and Victoria exchanged glances - they both had the same idea.

"The thick one" Victoria said with a good amount of confidence.

*Wait, the less to burn, the faster it can burn?* Adrex thought to himself, just before Smearchuckle took two candles, and held them to each row.
It went rather fast, and the light was very bright - brightest from the thick row - but when the two rows faded, it was simultaneously.

This was unexpected for both Adrex and Victoria.
How could this be?
Adrex had to rub his bridge between his eyes as he pondered this.

Victoria was the first to break the silence:
"So, they burn equally fast?"

"In free form, yes" Smearchuckle replied, before continuing:
"As you also saw, the thick row burned brighter than the thin row.
That could imply, that when we seal the two rows in two rocket with the same size nozzle, the thick row's rocket would burn faster, and fly with greater force upwards, right?"

That sounded like perfect logic to Adrex.
Victoria nodded as well, as she leaned towards a table.

"Now, I spread the powder in a nice row, and as you saw, the rows burn fast" Smearchuckle continued, as she held up her hands to explain further.
"The way we make rockets, is by storing a certain amount of powder in the bottom of the rocket - just above the nozzle.
The nozzle size determines how much can be pushed through at the same time.
Still keeping up?"

*So far, so good*, Adrex thought to himself, as he nodded again.

"And as you might have thought; more powder - more flame.
There's a small catch, however" she said with a more serious expression.
"I spread the powder on lines, which meant they could burn as much as the wanted, and produce all the fire they could.
As the powder burned in the row, it would ignite the rest of the row - but with the same speed, since the ratio between the two rows are the same."

Suddenly Adrex got what she was saying, as she continued:

"But when you pack that into a rocket, it's not in lines - it's just a pack, that almost burn everything at the same time.
Take a guess at what happens, when more powder, in a rocket, all burns at the same time?"

Adrex didn't have to guess.
He saw what happened the other night, and had felt the effect around him, as the rocket had started flying, and blew up, sending all it's colors flying around his curled up tail.

Victoria looked slightly confused though.
"Then it will come out faster, and with a bigger nozzle push the rocket up, right?"

Adrex held his hands up near each other so Victoria could see them, as he shaped them to a ball, and stretched his fingers so show an explosion.

Smearchuckle had a wry smile on her face, as she nodded towards Adrex' motions.
"I had the same thought, dear sister, but Adrex got it right, I'm afraid.
When you pack powder too tight, it will blow up, sending everything flying around your ears.
There's simply too great an expansion, and our rockets are merely made of clay and parchment."

She threw her hands up in the air, as she exclaimed: "And that is why I can't make a bigger rocket with more content in. 
It will blow up in our face."

*Clay and parchments?* Adrex thought to himself.
Well, there was something stronger out there, for sure.

"How about making it of metal then?" he asked.

Smearchuckle looked at him with a bit of confusion.
"There's a couple of issues there, my dear tinker" she started.
"If you make it of metal, it will be heavier, and require more powder.
And if load more powder, you will get a equally short burn, just with way more force in it. 
That, however, will make it more uncontrollable".

It was like a frustration she could get off her mind.

"And if that wasn't enough, metal rockets would cost way more to make, and a piece of metal would drop down from the sky when fired."

She finally sighed.
"I'm sorry, Adrex, but I don't think you can get such a heavy object up with a rocket."

Adrex had to admit defeat.
He simply didn't know enough about the topic to pitch in with something valuable at this point.
"Yeah, you are right. 
That would require a canon, or something like it.
Perhaps not as big, but..."

*Actually, that's not a bad idea*, Adrex thought to himself.
Canons shot huge cannonballs, which required way too much force.

"How about a small canon to fire the glitter in the air?" he asked.

There was a quiet moment, as Smearchuckle sat frozen to the place, clearly thinking about it.
As Adrex looked to Victoria, she had a very focused stare in the ground, as she too had started thinking about it.

Smearchuckle broke the silence:
"We could separate the powder in the rocket from the package with the glitter in, and we have fuses..." she started, before she made some big eyes to her sister.

Adrex sometimes had short, mute conversations with Yurgunn, when he had proposed something, and she didn't even wanted to say anything, but just make facial expression, which they back and forth with, until it was decided that it was a ridiculous suggestion.

The conversation Victoria and Smearchuckle held, however, was way longer, and required way more expressions, but still without a sound.
At some point Smearchuckle, facing her sister, nodded towards Adrex with a very firm look.
Victoria turned to Adrex, as she licked her mouth, and with a very charming voice said:

"Adrex dear, why don't we... make a deal?"

*What? yes, sure - wait no, not too hasty*, Adrex thought to himself, as his heart suddenly started pounding faster.

"Ehm-" he started, as his mind kept racing.

*Deal - why? 
What do they want they want a deal about?
They are not serious about making canons, are they?
No they can't...
Actually it could be a good idea to send up only the glitter... and... I came up with that*.

Yes, that was it.
But Adrex didn't want to make canons with glitter.
He wanted...

*A mobile cannon which could send something out in a heartbeat.*

"Deal, you say?"
There was something to gain here.

Victoria gentle put her hand around his arm, as she closely leaned in him, padding his shoulder with her other hand, as her silky smooth voice continued.

"You know - that was a really good suggestion you had there."

*Oh dear, she smells wonderful*, Adrex thought has he had kept hammering.

"And,-" she continued with a lulled tone.
"That could put us in a *very* fine position on the market, if *we* don't tell them about how it works, right?"

Adrex had a hard time thinking clearly.



---


He had let himself out without real words - just a mumble, some nodding, and the piece of paper he had written the formula on.

<!-- 
* 75% - Potassium nitrate / , dry
* 15% - charcoal
* 10% - Sulfur -->

"Three quarter potassium nitrate. The rest is split three/fifth of charcoal, and two/fifth sulfur".

Apparently this was what the twins used as "black powder", as they called it.
Very fitting, of cause.
It was a fine powder, but to think it could have the effect to send up rockets was very new to Adrex.
And if it could be make an actual explosion, then Adrex had just what he wanted for his mobile trap.
Just take a barrel, stomp in some of this black powder, and it would fly in the direction you held it?

*Marvelous*, Adrex thought to himself, as he headed towards the shop.
And he hadn't given them any secrets at all.
He had just come up with some suggestions, and then...

A smile curled up on his face.
Then Victoria had kissed him on the cheek, as she had let her soft body rest towards his.
He could feel his heart start thumbing faster again. 
Her face had been so close to his, with those puppy eyes, and that smile of hers.
It was like he was next to her again.
He could even recall her perfume of roses, as she had gently brushed his hand with hers, as her gentle words had left her beautiful lips.

He might need a moment for himself when he got back to the shop...
